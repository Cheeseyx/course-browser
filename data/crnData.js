descCRN[10001] = '<p>Notes:<br />The main objectives of this introductory course are: to explore the historical construction of racial categories in the United States; to understand the systemic impact of racism on contemporary social processes; to consider popular views about race in the light of emerging scholarship in the field; and to develop an ability to connect personal experiences to larger, collective realities. We will engage several questions as a group: What are the historical and sociological foundations of racial categories? When does focusing on race make someone racist? What is white privilege, and why does it matter? All students will be asked to think and write about their own racial identity. This course, or its equivalent, is required for majors and minors.  (4 credits) <br/></p>';
descCRN[10002] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with GEOG 250-01; no first year students allowed* This course is built at the crossroads between critical race studies and urban sociology, and draws on important strains within cultural studies, WGSS, and critical/postmodern geography. We will investigate our own personal cognitive maps and social locations, including our complicity in dominant spatial and racial logics. Lectures, assignments, and activities encourage an understanding of the creation and on-going production of space and scale, and develop insight into racialized communities and identities as sites of conflict, struggle, and potential solidarity rather than fixed categories of representation or consumption. A segment of the course will focus on St. Paul and the impact of the Vietnam War, looking particularly at the construction of Hmong and other Southeast Asian American communities and identities. This course requires prior exposure to at least one of the following areas: American Studies, human geography, sociology of race/ethnicity, or urban studies.</p>';

descCRN[10007] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Permission of instructor required; application required; cross-listed with HIST 294-04* This course introduces students to theories and practices of Public History – the ways that people understand and make use of the past in our everyday lives – by focusing on one topic, that of African American History.<br/> <br/>Public History now encompasses museum studies, archival management, historic preservation, historical archaeology, oral history, and cultural resources management; but on a larger scale Public Historians acknowledge the multiple ways that we all preserve knowledge about the past and make meaning from the sources we use in our everyday lives. Expressions of historic memory occur in popular historical forms like community celebrations, archival collections, commemorative sites, family reunions, museum exhibits, and even video games, among many others. In this course, students learn about the ways that Public History is practiced, the rationales for undertaking this study, and the skills available to them in meeting their goals.<br/> <br/>With the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture during the past year, the Public History of African Americans has attracted sustained attention in the popular press, in museum circles, and in academic disciplines.   In this course, students will examine the theory and practice of Public History, including museum work, archives, public memory, and oral history. They will then proceed to consider how African American History has been presented (or omitted) from the larger narrative of North American/U.S. History. The course will include an examination of the politics of creating and building the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) and the interpretive dimensions of presenting that History to the wider public.<br/><br/>Participants must commit to a four-day field trip to Washington, D.C. during fall break and to some outside of class, on-site activities during the semester.</p>';

descCRN[10029] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* Confucius said, “If I point out one corner of a square and the student can\'t come back with the other three, I won\'t show him again." Hillel opined, “The shy one cannot learn, and the impatient one cannot teach.” Cultures ancient and modern have reflected on the responsibilities of teachers and students, and grappled with what constitutes an effective teacher or a successful student. What are the virtues—and perils—of discipleship? Of charisma? Should a teacher be gentle or forceful? Strict or lenient? Are teachers creators or conduits of tradition? This seminar will explore these questions in a range of contexts, Chinese and Western, historical and modern. Genres studied will include literature and film, as well as philosophical and religious texts.</p>';

Without knowing, we limit ourselves to thinking that our current perspective is the only way by which to view ourselves and the world. By analyzing Japanese, students can experience perceptual and cultural systems that are different from their own. At the same time, students may also discover that there are certain qualities that are common even in "exotic" languages such as Japanese. What is the function of the topic marker? Why can\'t you translate "he is cold" into Japanese word for word? Why are there so many different personal pronouns in Japanese? How do you express your feelings in Japanese? What is the relationship between your identity and gendered speech? This course provides opportunities to discuss these questions that students of Japanese commonly have.

descCRN[10064] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ART 294-01* The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years  has been, literally, revolutionary. This class explores the inherent relationship between material practices and shifting subjectivities, that is the resonance between the physical external world and internal, thinking subject. During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation.  Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of “Chinese” art and “Chinese” identity in Asia and on the global stage.</p>';

descCRN[10078] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ASIA 294-01* The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years  has been, literally, revolutionary. This class explores the inherent relationship between material practices and shifting subjectivities, that is the resonance between the physical external world and internal, thinking subject. During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation.  Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of “Chinese” art and “Chinese” identity in Asia and on the global stage.<br/></p>';
descCRN[10080] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Appropriate for first year and incoming students*<br/>We are surrounded by three dimensional design; from the architecture of our built environment to the tools and objects that surround us, to the human-altered landforms and plantings of our larger environment. All of these elements can be considered and affected by design choices which we make. In the class we build structures which can be considered from structural, aesthetic, and functional points of view. Some of these projects are built to very specific parameters so that trade-offs can be observed and measured. We smash a lot of things, but learn a lot about problem-solving along the way. The course includes a field trip to my farm/studio in Western Wisconsin where we install a large site-specific project. Past projects have included a collaboratively-built ninety-three foot long illuminated lantern across the pastures, as well as a series of kinetic structures. The food is great too! (4 credits)</p>';
