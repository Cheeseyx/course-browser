descCRN['10001&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />The main objectives of this introductory course are: to explore the historical construction of racial categories in the United States; to understand the systemic impact of racism on contemporary social processes; to consider popular views about race in the light of emerging scholarship in the field; and to develop an ability to connect personal experiences to larger, collective realities. We will engage several questions as a group: What are the historical and sociological foundations of racial categories? When does focusing on race make someone racist? What is white privilege, and why does it matter? All students will be asked to think and write about their own racial identity. This course, or its equivalent, is required for majors and minors.

We will investigate our own personal cognitive maps and social locations, including our complicity in dominant spatial and racial logics. Lectures, assignments, and activities encourage an understanding of the creation and on-going production of space and scale, and develop insight into racialized communities and identities as sites of conflict, struggle, and potential solidarity rather than fixed categories of representation or consumption. A segment of the course will focus on St. Paul and the impact of the Vietnam War, looking particularly at the construction of Hmong and other Southeast Asian American communities and identities. This course requires prior exposure to at least one of the following areas: American Studies, human geography, sociology of race/ethnicity, or urban studies.</p>';

Expressions of historic memory occur in popular historical forms like community celebrations, archival collections, commemorative sites, family reunions, museum exhibits, and even video games, among many others. In this course, students learn about the ways that Public History is practiced, the rationales for undertaking this study, and the skills available to them in meeting their goals.<br/> <br/>With the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture during the past year, the Public History of African Americans has attracted sustained attention in the popular press, in museum circles, and in academic disciplines.   In this course, students will examine the theory and practice of Public History, including museum work, archives, public memory, and oral history. They will then proceed to consider how African American History has been presented (or omitted) from the larger narrative of North American/U.S. History. The course will include an examination of the politics of creating and building the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) and the interpretive dimensions of presenting that History to the wider public.<br/><br/>Participants must commit to a four-day field trip to Washington, D.C. during fall break and to some outside of class, on-site activities during the semester.</p>';

Hillel opined, “The shy one cannot learn, and the impatient one cannot teach.” Cultures ancient and modern have reflected on the responsibilities of teachers and students, and grappled with what constitutes an effective teacher or a successful student. What are the virtues—and perils—of discipleship? Of charisma? Should a teacher be gentle or forceful? Strict or lenient? Are teachers creators or conduits of tradition? This seminar will explore these questions in a range of contexts, Chinese and Western, historical and modern. Genres studied will include literature and film, as well as philosophical and religious texts.</p>';

descCRN['10064&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ART 294-01* The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years  has been, literally, revolutionary. This class explores the inherent relationship between material practices and shifting subjectivities, that is the resonance between the physical external world and internal, thinking subject. During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation.  Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of “Chinese” art and “Chinese” identity in Asia and on the global stage.</p>';

descCRN['10211&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Our common vocabulary of love presents it as a force that strikes and knocks down its victims. It comes like a fever and it disables cognition. Lovers "fall," they are "smitten," "head over heels," "crazy" for each other. Love is both mania and obsession, both a euphoria that alters one\'s view of the world as a whole and an exclusion of the whole world, a radical narrowing of our normally capacious imaginative and perceptual faculties down to the simplest and smallest of human frames: a face, or the sound of a voice. For American authors of the 18th and 19th century, love and madness were twinned sites of altered consciousness that represented the radical "others" of Enlightenment reason, psychic parallels to and extensions of the wilds of the New World and the uncontrollable crowds and freedoms of the new democracy. This course will examine love and madness from multiple perspectives, including the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment, gender and sexuality, the American Gothic, violence, and sin.

Thus, if we want to craft effective solutions to issues such as ocean acidification, air pollution, or climate change, we must start with the human behaviors that lead to them. We will cover psychological principles, theories, and methods and explore the complex web of factors underlying environmentally sustainable and unsustainable actions. A strong theme throughout the semester is the intersection of identity - personal, social, and cultural - and environmentalism.  We will explore questions such as, "Why do some groups of people feel a part of the sustainability movement while others feel alienated from it or skeptical of it?"; "Who takes action on behalf of the natural environment, under what circumstances, and why?"; and "How can we create contexts that promote true sustainability?" Psychology of Sustainable Behavior is a project-based class with a strong civic engagement component.

Course readings focus on suburbs, which are the dominant mode of metropolitan living in contemporary America. We will consider the history of suburbanization, the political economy of growth in the suburbs, the rise of smart growth strategies, and other attempts to foster change in the suburban experience (including the New Urbanism, green building and green movements, and regionalism). We will also consider how suburbs are now experiencing demographic changes and investigate the struggle for community in historic and contemporary suburbs. This seminar will thus complicate the conventional narrative of suburbs as sprawling, inauthentic and homogeneous places. Students will further enrich their understanding of issues covered in the course by conducting original research that examines ways in which American suburbs are changing and/or remaining the same despite efforts to the contrary.

By the 1960s, this area of inquiry was referred to variously as "human ecology." Over the last decade, certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as "political ecology." The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts.

Beyond agriculture, we will also examine other sectoral issues in relation to agriculture or as stand alone environmental concerns. These themes include: human population growth, consumption, biodiversity, climate change, and environmental health. We will be trying on a number of theoretical lenses from geography’s broad human-environment tradition (such as physical geography, cultural ecology, commodity chain analysis, political ecology, resource geography, the human dimensions of global change, hazards geography and environmental justice). In other words, I not only want us to explore a range of environmental issues, but also to grapple with theory and how this informs our understanding of the human-environment interface.

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Writing in an age when religious belief had lost credence as a foundation for ethics, Nietzsche and Freud confronted the groundlessness of value systems while recognizing the impossibility of living without them. Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics - along with brute force - to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence. What will emerge for students is a complex, heterogeneous vision of the conquest and early colonization in which non-European voices speak loudly on their own behalf. <br/>Cross-listed with Latin American Studies 415 and International Studies 415.

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others. By placing these systems in an appropriate historical context, we will identify and analyze key elements, biases and influences that shape the disciplines of History and World Religions.</p>';

In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate how human societies in the pre-modern world developed different sorts of technologies to confront and adapt to the challenges presented by their environments. Drawing upon a diverse array of sources, including glacial ice core data and saints’ lives, we will explore how human technologies changed local environments in both intended and unintended ways. Environmental consequences presented new challenges that required further technological adaptation, fundamentally shaping trajectories of societal development from classical China to medieval Europe, from ancient Oceania to the Americas. In studying the formative relationship between technology and the environment in pre-modern global contexts, we will arrive at a more informed understanding of the emergence of the modern world. For our purposes in this course, “technology” will include not only physical tools but also political-cultural ideologies, systems of government, religions, scientific theories, and techniques of domestication. “Environment” will similarly be defined broadly: climate, physical geography, biosphere, and urban settlements.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine a diversity of historical artifacts, literary texts, and artistic works that engage with Arthurian lore. We will approach each instance of such “Arthuriana” as a construct particular to its own time and place of production. Indeed, like most classics, the Arthurian legend endures not because of the allure of its original form but because of its fundamental adaptability. Camelot was, is, and will continue to be a stage on which societies play out their hopes, fears, and everything in between. Our goal, therefore, will be to illuminate and understand how contemporary social, cultural, and political agendas have shaped and, in turn, have been shaped by each compelling incarnation of Arthur’s court. Course topics will span the gamut of Arthurian tradition: from medieval Welsh folklore re-imagining the post-Roman “Dark Ages” to T.H.

In this course we will journey back to the period of the "Scientific Revolution" to investigate how and why people began to distinguish sharply between the three systems. Who lost, and who profited, from this transition? What similarities between religion, magic and science persisted? To understand this turning point, we will compare contemporaneous cases of individuals who practiced magic, science and religion and ran afoul of authorities. Their trials highlight how the three spheres began to diverge. Cases we will consider might include the 1633 trial of Galileo, and the 1663 witchcraft trial of Tempel Anneke in Germany.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence. What will emerge for students is a complex, heterogeneous vision of the conquest and early colonization in which non-European voices speak loudly on their own behalf.

descCRN['10443&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Although all humans are born with the capacity to learn the sounds of any language, part of learning our native language is learning to categorize sounds into groups specific to that language, thereby filtering out many of the actual phonetic distinctions and concentrating only on those that are important. Just as we, as English speakers, may have trouble hearing the difference between the voiced and voiceless click consonants in Zulu, so speakers of other languages may not hear the difference between the vowels in "beat" and "bit," because this small distinction isn\'t important in their language. Phonology is the study of how different languages organize sounds into perceptual categories. In this class we will look at data from a wide variety of different languages, as well as from several dialects of English, including children\'s acquisition of a phonological system.

While media are central to the continued production of a sense of "the world" at large or the "global" scale, media industries are situated geographically, culturally and institutionally.  Even if they promise worldwide coverage or are multinational companies, there is much to be gained from studying how media are produced and distributed differently according to specific social, political, economic and historical conditions.

The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design.

descCRN['10460&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with GERM 279-01; taught in English*<br/>For thousands of years value has been scrutinized in philosophy, art history, and economic analysis, as it cuts across three constitutive aspects of social, cultural, and political life: economy, aesthetics, and ethics. Not only do we have and impose on the world our moral, aesthetic, and exchange values, but these three fields often become difficult to distinguish, as is evident in the slippery flexibility of words that allow us to say as much “this painting is bad or worthless” as “I think this person is bad or worthless,” or “this is a bad, or worthless, remark” and “this is a bad or worthless check.” This course will focus primarily on influential accounts of value in aesthetic theory, while also examining the ways in which aesthetic value demarcates itself from or implicates its moral and economic counterparts, and what the interplays among the three fields entail for aesthetic value. Our readings will focus on the impact of primarily German thought on the formation of modern aesthetic theory—from the early eighteenth century through the Enlightenment and Romanticism to high modernism and the Frankfurt School.<br/>Class and readings in English.

descCRN['10469&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Prerequisite MUSI 113 OR permission of instructor*<br/>This course traces the development of Western art music from its beginnings in the monophonic chant of early Christianity, through the development of polyphonic genres in the Renaissance (mass, motet, madrigal), to the emergence of opera in Italy around 1600 and the stylistic revolution that we now call the Baroque (including musical life in the extravagant court of Louis XIV in France and Johann Sebastian Bach’s masterful synthesis of Baroque styles), to the sophisticated, multi-movement sonata structures of late 18th century Viennese classicism. Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students’ abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students’ retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary. (4 credits)</p>';

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Writing in an age when religious belief had lost credence as a foundation for ethics, Nietzsche and Freud confronted the groundlessness of value systems while recognizing the impossibility of living without them. Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

descCRN['10592&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with AMST 203-01*<br/>Americans, at least since the Founding era, have cherished the ideal of political equality.  Unlike European nations, the United States did not inherit economic class distinctions from a feudal past. But time and again, American social reformers and mass movements have highlighted inconsistencies between the value of equality and the actual practice of democracy. Through the extension of rights to citizens who were previously excluded or treated as second-class citizens, such as women and African Americans, the polity has become more inclusive. But over the last three decades American citizens have grown increasingly unequal in terms of income and wealth.  The central question posed by this course is the implications of such vast economic inequality for American democracy. Do these disparities between citizens curtail, limit, and perhaps threaten the functioning of genuinely representative governance?  In this course will 1) Explore what other social scientists, mostly economists and sociologists, know about contemporary inequality, particularly in terms of its causes, manifestation, and socio-economic effects; 2) Consider the concept of inequality in political theory and in American political thought, and; 3) Examine the current relationship between economic inequality and each of three major aspects of the American political  system: political voice, representation, and public policy.

This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question "how we should live our lives as individuals" and "how we should live together in peace and justice" late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, "the people," nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day.<br/><br/>The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi. To the extent that they shed light on late medieval thought, we will also touch on classical political theorists such as Aristotle and Cicero as well as Muslim and Jewish thinkers such as ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rusd.

We will then turn to cognitive psychology to describe the mental and emotional processes that underlie the judgments and decisions we make when faced with data vs. personal experience. We will also explore social psychological theories and studies that help explain why people deny climate change even in places where its impacts are likely to be severe.

This course covers definitive works of the most important authors of Russia’s Golden Age, namely Pushkin’s Byronic novel in verse, Eugene Onegin; Lermontov’s novella of an ironic anti-hero, A Hero of Our Time; Gogol’s absurdist and hilarious novellas The Nose and The Overcoat; Turgenev’s exposition of intergenerational and ideological conflict, Fathers and Sons; Dostoevsky’s most famous novel Crime and Punishment, a thrilling “why-dun-it” with a sympathetic axe-murderer; and Tolstoy’s masterpiece Anna Karenina, a morality tale of adultery and self-determination. The course will introduce students to the art of literary criticism through an examination of the literary aspects of these classic works. The course will also include discussions about Russian culture and history as well as universal questions regarding the self, society and the state, freedom of choice, the existence of God, and other daunting questions about human existence.

Wright Mills dscribed it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples\' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization.

The course focuses on Trump’s rise as the most visible example of the rise of rise of right wing populism, but will also use some comparative material to examine similar right-wing populist insurgencies in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. We will explore the debates of how best to explain populism, reading material from a variety of disciplines. Along the way, we will address questions such as: What is populism and how do we study it? What distinguishes populists from traditional political elites? What social forces produce populism and can they account for how populist movements have varied over time? Is populism always a right wing phenomenon associated with xenophobia, racism, and sexism or can a left-wing, progressive populism be a constructive force of social change? In answering these questions, we will critically assess popular explanations for Trump’s rise, including arguments about the idea of “white rage,” the rebellion of the white working class, and the emasculation of men.</p>';
descCRN['10666&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only*<br/>As Frederick Rudolf aptly noted, the history of American education "is American history" and reveals "the central purposes and driving directions of American society." The advent of mass schooling represents a profound exercise in collective self-definition. As with much else in a democracy, deciding whom to teach, what to teach, and how to teach have been subjects of lively debate in the US from the early nineteenth century to the dawning of the twenty-first. This course offers a broad overview of the overarching political controversies durrounding the historical development of public schooling in America. We begin with a survey of 19th-century movements to define elementary schooling as the chosen instrument for nation-building, for safeguarding democratic self-governance, and for resolving with the cascading social disorders implicated in the rise of urbanization, mass immigration, and industrial capitalism. The rise of high schools in the early twentieth century is the second major topic of interest, and more specifically, progressive-era debates about the relationship between public schools and colleges and universities. This era begets the great ideological fault-lines underlying educational theory and practice in the US that lasted the 20th century into the 21st. The dramatic post-war reconstruction of public schooling is the third major focus of the course. We explore the proliferation of federal government mandates to secularize, integrate, assimilate, equalize, multiculturalize, and expunge racism and sexism from the curriculum, all the while raising academic standards for all. With these directivescame vastly expanded government funding for social science research trained on evaluating public schools\' efforts to realize these new benchmarks of educational progress. We observe this rebirth of the social sciences as arbiters of educational policy debates. The final section of the course revolves around contemporary disputes over school choice policies and the federal No-Child-Left-Behind initiatives. These latest campaigns to democratize academic excellence have followed a familiar, recurring script of US policy making since the 1980s: deregulation, de-centralization, consumer choice, managerial and administrative prerogatives in public agencies re-invented in the image of governance in the corporate sector, and the elaboration of benchmarks to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of educational practices. We consider how recent experience indicate limitations to privatization, corporatization, and marketization as solutions to the educational crisis, and perhaps, suggest the beginnings of a renewed search for answers to the riddle of public education.</p>';

Then I discovered that the immigrants were American History” (Oscar Handling, 1951:3). Over the course of the last five centuries, millions of people, young and old, male and female, married and single, left their homelands to seek a better life. Originating in different localities, they escaped famine and hunger, war, religious persecution and intolerance, colonialism, and revolutionary turmoil. Some left following their “adventurous” spirit. While many died before reaping the benefits of their life transforming quest, others survived to build a new nation. While all contributed to building the country, not all left a written account of their experiences. Who were these people who, willingly or forcibly, left all they knew behind? What were they escaping from? What were their dreams? Hardships? How were they received by those who, by pure accident of history, had arrived before them?<br/><br/>This class is an expedition into the past with an eye on the present, examining firsthand accounts left by immigrants and about them. What does an 18th century Scottish indentured servant may have in common with a 21st century migrant farm worker? What does a turn of the 20th century Polish immigrant might have in common with a 21st century Arab immigrant? What does a Japanese picture bride might share with a contemporary Russian bride? Delving into divergent historical periods and differing groups, the goal is to develop a better understanding of parallels and variations, hopes and dreams, the ease and challenges that immigrants have experienced, and continue to face.</p>';

In this course, we adopt a sociological lens to examine the systematic operation of class divisions through cultural mediums, considering how class identities become formulated and class cultures become differentiated within varying institutional contexts. Our study will track the category of class along multiple lines of cultural distinction, examining class subjectivity as it is constructed in relation to gender, race, and sexual identity, and as it is built around moral discourses of difference and symbolic economies of style, taste, and preference.</p>';

Not only do we have and impose on the world our moral, aesthetic, and exchange values, but these three fields often become difficult to distinguish, as is evident in the slippery flexibility of words that allow us to say as much “this painting is bad or worthless” as “I think this person is bad or worthless,” or “this is a bad, or worthless, remark” and “this is a bad or worthless check.” This course will focus primarily on influential accounts of value in aesthetic theory, while also examining the ways in which aesthetic value demarcates itself from or implicates its moral and economic counterparts, and what the interplays among the three fields entail for aesthetic value.

It focuses on interactions between humans, urban ecosystems, and the built environment. With over half of the world’s population now living in cities, cities have assumed a critical role in shaping local, regional, and global ecologies.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate how human societies in the pre-modern world developed different sorts of technologies to confront and adapt to the challenges presented by their environments. Drawing upon a diverse array of sources, including glacial ice core data and saints’ lives, we will explore how human technologies changed local environments in both intended and unintended ways. Environmental consequences presented new challenges that required further technological adaptation, fundamentally shaping trajectories of societal development from classical China to medieval Europe, from ancient Oceania to the Americas. In studying the formative relationship between technology and the environment in pre-modern global contexts, we will arrive at a more informed understanding of the emergence of the modern world. For our purposes in this course, “technology” will include not only physical tools but also political-cultural ideologies, systems of government, religions, scientific theories, and techniques of domestication. “Environment” will similarly be defined broadly: climate, physical geography, biosphere, and urban settlements. This course fulfills the global and/or comparative history as well as the pre-1800 requirements for the history major.</p>';
descCRN['10850&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course examines the interaction, commerce, and conflict between the Islamic Caliphate and Christian Byzantium from the origins of Islam in the seventh century to 1453 and the collapse of the Byzantine Empire. These two empires were bound together by shared space, common interests, and episodic distrust. They were Frenemies. The sources for this study are Byzantine and Islamic histories from the period, together with critical analysis of those sources. In addition and importantly the literature and art these two empires produced provide vital and illuminating sight into these bodies, including their view of one another. Counts for the Middle Eastern and Islamic Civilization concentration and as a context course for the Classics major or minor.</p>';

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others. By placing these systems in an appropriate historical context, we will identify and analyze key elements, biases and influences that shape the disciplines of History and World Religions.</p>';

Of course, we know their stories only second hand.  This course explores how narratives about martyrs ("martyrologies") relate to the formation of religious identities and communities.  Over the course of the semester, we will analyze martyrologies from the early Christian and Jewish periods, the beginnings of Islam, the sixteenth century, and modernity. We will pay special attention to the social and political contexts with which martyrs often found themselves at odds (including the Roman Empire in the ancient past, and the U.S./Middle East conflicts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries).  In class discussions, readings, and written work, you will have the opportunity to reflect on the following questions (among others): How do the stories we tell about martyrs shape the way we understand religious practices and beliefs?  How do narratives of bearing witness, suffering, and death help to illumine relationships between religious and political domains?  How might our current understanding of martyrdom be informed for better and for worse by a study of history?</p>';

descCRN['10854&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />French culture and society underwent sweeping changes with the rise of capitalism and the industrial revolution in the 19th century. With these changes, new narratives emerged that we continue to see even in today\'s culture. They asked questions such as: why do two people fall in love? Why does an individual strive for a better social standing? Is empathy possible in a capitalist society? The answers to these questions are complex, and often relate to what is known as "mimetic desire," a term coined by French theorist Rene Girard in his book Deceit, Desire and the Novel (Le mensonge romantique et la verite romanesque). We will examine the relationships of deceit and desire to money and the marketplace in 19th-century France, and, in the process, learn more about our own society. This course offers a survey of 19th century French literature (novels, plays, short stories, and poetry) linked to the theme of the course, including works by Audouard, Balzac, Desbordes-Valmore, Flaubert, Hugo, Sand, Zola, and others. It will cover several major 19th-century literary movements and styles (Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism). Taught in French. Offered occasionally. (4 credits)</p>';

This includes music. Music heals, empowers, and exposes--joy, pain, love, anger, happiness, suffering and hope. Using a black feminist, intersectional lens, this course is a topical introduction to various traditions within African American music from the enslavement period until the present.  Not meant to be exhaustive, the course will examine the connections between music and major turning points in African American social, cultural, and political history.  The course also pays special attention to the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexuality impact the creation, interpretation, performance, and reception of black protest music.</p>';
