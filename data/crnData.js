descCRN['crs30824'] = 'Notes:<br/>Popular culture is often perceived as only a means of entertainment. In this course, however, we treat popular culture as central to the production and reproduction of identity categories to examine how images, ideologies and behaviors are created and represented in American popular culture. Most importantly, the course will explore the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class in popular culture representations of identity to broadly discuss how identity markers are produced, how they change over time, and how they interlock to form larger structural inequalities and systems of oppression. We will focus on representations of Latinx bodies in the media, blackness and criminality, feminist politics and post-feminist culture, and representations of race and gender in animated films. In addition, students will question their own taken-for-granted notions about what popular culture is and what it does to gendered and raced relations to situate popular culture as a contested space of subjugation and disempowerment as well as one of resistance and possibility.';

descCRN['crs30368'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with HIST 277-01*<br/>Japan\'s rapid industrialization in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and its phenomenal rise as the number two economic power in the world after the devastation wrought by World War II, have led many scholars to declare Japan a model worthy of emulation by all "developing" nations. After an examination of feudal Japan, this course probes the nature and course of Japan\'s "amazing transformation" and analyzes the consequences of its strengths as a nation-state. Considerable study of Japanese art, literature, and religion will be undertaken and American attitudes toward the Japanese and their history will also be examined. (4 credits)';
descCRN['crs30835'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with ART 270-01*<br/>What defines Sacred Art or makes a Sacred Space? What roles do material practices play in fostering a religious experience? This course contemplates answers to these questions by focusing on religious visual culture in Asia and examining how intangible concepts of the divine have become tangible in art and architecture. To better understand the multilayered functioning of devotional objects and spaces associated with religious doctrines such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shintoism, the class will explore foundations in iconography and then compare different religious objects and spaces through concepts such as gender, state power, the body, nature, the grotesque, and death. The meaning of such imagery is not static, however. Therefore, we will also reflect on how the significance of religious objects change in the space of a museum. Ultimately, this course allows us to contemplate the multifaceted ways religious beliefs have been visualized and how these manifestations exemplify systems of cultural exchange in Asia.';
descCRN['crs30020'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with AMST 315-01 and HIST 315-01; no first year students allowed*<br/>In this discussion-based seminar, we will examine U.S. Global presence through the lenses of empire, diaspora, and transnationalism. We will look specifically at U.S. involvement in the Philippines and Viet Nam from 1898 to 1975 as moments of military occupation and cultural domination, as well as turning points for U.S. nation-building. What is "imperialism" and how is it different from "hegemony"? How did U.S. imperial adventures in Asia help to recreate a Western geographic imaginary of the "East"? How did they reshape or reconfigure "American" positions and identities? Under what circumstances were former imperial subjects allowed to generate racialized communities? To what extent are memories of U.S. conflicts in Asia cultivated, proliferated, twisted, or suppressed? What lessons can be garnered for the contemporary historical moment? Other topics for exploration include: internment, transracial adoption, commemorations of war, and anti-imperialist/anti-war movements. Cross-listed with American Studies 315 and History 315.

descCRN['crs30695'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with GEOG 320-01; first day attendance required*<br/>Since the last century, Asia has experienced rapid urbanization. It is now home to over half of the world’s most populated cities. By 2010, the urban population in the Asia-Pacific region has surpassed the population of the United States and the European Union combined. In this course, we will focus on cities in East, Southeast and South Asia. We will first contextualize the rapid urbanization in the region’s changing political economy, and identify urban issues that are unique to this region. We will further explore different theoretical approaches to understand Asian cities; several of them challenge mainstream urban theories rooted in the experiences of West European and North American cities. Upon the completion of this course, students will acquire substantive knowledge on contemporary trends of urban development in Asia, and develop familiarity with related ongoing theoretical debates. In addition, students will conduct individual research projects to develop deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes in Asia.';

descCRN['crs30170'] = 'Notes:<br/>It’s entirely possible for one to analyze the meanings of most texts—their themes, morals, historical significances, and so on—without paying much attention to the formal and linguistic elements that produce such meanings. Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously figures the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up such questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, and the very question of what poetry is.

In ENGL 136, we will read plays--both classic and modern--as literary texts and talk about the craft that went into their writing. But we will also take field trips to see several plays at different theaters in Minneapolis and St. Paul; we will study theater reviews and write some of our own; we will meet people who work on technical aspects of productions (like lighting and costumes) and learn about the craft of building productions; and we will think, talk, and write about the relationship between the dramatic arts and current events. As part of our larger goal of putting theater in context, the "current" events we study will cover topics as diverse as science vs religion, processes of nation building, personal identities put on trial, class politics and accents, and historical notions of property, and the work we read will range from Shakespeare to the present.';

For example, can the beautiful be political? What happens to nature\'s beauty in an era of environmental crisis? And how are shifting gender norms redefining beauty in today\'s world? The novels we will study critique and analyze these issues even as they revel in the complexity of beauty across time, space, artistic forms, media, and cultures.

This course offers you the opportunity to do so. Beginning with Ferdinand de Saussure’s influential Course in General Linguistics, we’ll trace the development of literary theory through structuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, feminism, gender studies, queer theory, Black studies, postcolonial theory, trauma theory, affect theory, and ecocriticism. Since our approach will be to treat literary theory as a field of study in itself, we’ll be reading almost exclusively primary texts from this field—though, if you engage these texts seriously, they will most likely change the way you read just about everything, from poems and novels to television shows and text messages. This course will be of interest to students of all levels who are interested in learning about literary theory and are willing to be intellectually challenged.

descCRN['crs30173'] = 'Notes:<br/>In the past fifty years, science fiction has emerged as the primary cultural form for thinking about human extinction: climate catastrophe and natural disasters, plagues that empty continents, and species suicide through war. But science fiction has also emerged as the primary cultural form for imagining a near boundless future through technological progress: artificial superintelligence, cybernetic enhancement of the human, and the possibility of utopian political order. Facing such disorienting and unfathomable changes, science fiction seeks with frantic energy to understand what it means to be a human and to live a meaningful life. Why are we here? What are we to become? How will the promises of technology, or the lethal threats of scarcity, change what it means to be a thinking, feeling human? In this course we will examine works of science fiction as complex aesthetic achievements, as philosophical inquiries into the nature of being and time, and as theoretical examinations of the nature of human cognition. We will engage in intensive readings of contemporary texts, including works by Ted Chiang, Lidia Yuknavitch, Philip K.

descCRN['crs30174'] = 'Notes:<br/>As the United states lurched toward murderous civil war, a group of passionate, visionary, and bizarre artists set out to discover the soul of America. From 1850 to 1855, in one of the most astonishing creative convergences in literary history, the artists of what would come to be known as the American Renaissance wrote stories and poems that would enlighten, thrill, and terrify generations of readers. With aesthetic wonder and philosophical insight, they revealed both the angels and demons of human nature, inventing a uniquely American spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they damned it all to hell. Their works were spiritual and blasphemous, elegant and profane, beatific and pornographic, irreverently comic and heartwrenchingly sentimental. Everything that was written in America after this period would, in one way or another, have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this small cluster of artists. In this course we will read texts by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. (4 credits)';

descCRN['crs30180'] = 'Notes:<br/>A historically small area of Ireland—called the Pale—was held under British rule in the late-medieval period. To be “beyond the pale” is to cross over some invisible, often arbitrary, boundary, to be inconveniently and antisocially out of line. Many postcolonial Irish and Caribbean writers have been forced to exist beyond the pale politically and in terms of their access (or lack of it) to the literary establishment. This idiomatic connection to Ireland has a more concrete resonance in Jamaica, where the Irish are the second largest ethnic group after people of African descent, and many of Jamaica’s placenames derive from Irish locations. Taking up these fascinating links, this course will explore the significance of Irish-Caribbean literary and cultural connections in art, dance (live Irish musicians and a céilí dance instructor will visit our class!), poetry, theatre, and fiction. We will ask what it means to be from a small island in a globalizing world by reading authors such as Claude McKay, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Marlon James, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Lorna Goodison, Frank McCourt, Eavan Boland, Grace Nichols, Nicole Dennis-Benn, and Sara Baume.';

In the last few decades, the young adult genre has been growing in scope and in ambition, and much of it is being written by exciting new authors, closer to the age of their protagonists. In this class we will study some new and foundational texts of the genre, discussing subjects like depiction of mental illness, the political implications of fantasy novels, and the “We Need Diverse Books” campaign. Meanwhile, you will be working on your own YA projects, learning for yourself what makes these books tick.';

descCRN['crs30176'] = 'Notes:<br/>In Shakespeare’s England, whipping, branding, mutilation (of the hand, nose, ears, or face), pillorying, hanging, burning, and beheading were common forms of legal punishment. The rigors of early modern law may seem strange or “barbaric” to us, yet we may recognize the intentions behind the laws: to restore order, to keep the peace, and to stabilize social relations. To grasp what justice meant to the early moderns and, in turn, what it means to us today, we will examine some of Shakespeare’s most challenging plays through the lens of legal and political philosophy. Plays such as Titus Andronicus, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, King Lear, and Othello stage a spectrum of responses to insult, injury, and violence. At the same time, the texts trouble the division between good and evil, justice and revenge. Our agenda is two-fold: to deepen our reading of Shakespearean drama and to use our knowledge to investigate difficult and still unresolved questions about the problem of evil, the dialectic between law and justice, and the meaning of the “good life.”';

This was only one of the many metamorphoses Nabokov underwent while in exile, moving from Russia to the Crimea, Cambridge UK, Berlin, Paris, Cambridge MA, Ithaca, Hollywood, and finally Montreux. Members of the Russian nobility, the Nabokovs lost everything with the 1917 Revolution except for their immense cultural capital, which Nabokov transformed into a tremendously productive career as a writer, critic, translator and scholar in Russian, French, and English. This course examines both the Russian (in translation) and English novels.

descCRN['crs30171'] = 'Notes:<br/>Jane Austen is still very much with us today. The mid-1990s saw an explosion of cinematic and televised adaptions of her novels. A flurry of Austenian mash-ups followed, merging zombies, vampires, and sea monsters with the trappings of the Regency era. Austen erotica, meanwhile, has not only emerged but boomed in recent years: in addition to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, we now have works such as Pride and Promiscuity and Spank Me, Mr. Darcy. Just what makes Austen so lastingly compelling and yet so open to diverse modes of adaptation and appropriation? This course approaches this question through an in-depth study of her novels and of some of their prominent film adaptations. We’ll attend to Austen’s particular narrative and rhetorical techniques (such as free-indirect discourse and irony), consider how these techniques do or do not lend themselves to adaptation, and explore how the formal innovations of cinema foreground other, less noted elements of her writing. We’ll also pay particular attention to how Austen registers the social and political issues of her time (e.g. gender inequities, the marriage imperative, the abolition of the slave trade, the Napoleonic wars), and query why most adaptations tend to simplify or simply occlude such issues. Finally, we’ll be interested in examining what Austen’s novels have to say about our own political present, particularly with regard to issues of race, gender, and class. Readings include Austen’s major novels, a number of their adaptations, and works of theory and criticism by Mary Favret, Frances Ferguson, William Galperin, Claudia Johnson, Deirdre Lynch, D. A. Miller, Mary Poovey, Edward Said, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Ian Watt, and others. No prior knowledge of Austen or of film studies is required.';

But they all have their roots in the nineteenth century, when they gained strength in part through their intersections with rhetorics of race. This course will interrogate notions of race as they were being invented—exploring how they were popularized and used to dominate, how they failed, and how they were resisted in 19th-century Britain. We will read canonical and non-canonical texts, including works by writers of color, visual images, scientific theories, fiction, and non-fiction. Considering locations throughout the British empire, we will explore intersections of race with the history of British slavery, colonial settlement, gender politics, enfranchisement, war, and religion. Working together with students at Michigan State University and the University of Detroit-Mercy who are taking the co-developed parallel course, students will produce a digital final project: a full scholarly edition—including appendices, annotations, and a scholarly introduction—of a nineteenth-century memoir written by a person of color.';

The course consists of three interlocking objectives. The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project.

From the 2000s on, new African migratory species have been emerging from the storied depths of international seawaters – the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Easy, hand-me-down categories have been spun around, to catch them in the nets of expert discourses about “the immigrant experience,” “the immigration crisis” or in a never-ending gauntlet of xenophobic narratives about the “plague” of illegal immigration. This course focuses primarily on firsthand accounts, in Sub-Saharan francophone film, literature, and popular culture, of the dark underside of transnational mobility. How do these marginalized voices resonate with contemporary francophone novels, essays, and films that attempt to convey and document their experiences? How do these transnational and transdiasporic wretched of the sea, abjected from the “sacred” spaces of citizenship at home and community abroad, force all postcolonial subjects, across the board, to attend to the structures of economic, political and cultural agency that underlie the radical emergence of previously "invisible" subalterns from the depths of an "other" Black Atlantic?

One of the oldest forms of human communications, they ultimately express the many ways we attempt to understand the world and be part of it. The explorers, their itineraries, and their diaries offer a complex view of this world, too. This course will expose the different interactions between maps, explorers, and writers from Antiquity to present. During the Renaissance and later explorations, colonization also ushered a significant challenge to Christian and Muslim accounts of their travels. The indigenous peoples of Africa and the Americas offered ways for the explorers and cartographers to express their consternation or their enthusiasm and to subvert what was ordered by kings or queens. Our class will explore the ways that Egyptians and Greeks (Aristotle, Plato, Ptolémée) influenced the thought of travelers of the Middle Ages (Marco Polo). We will discuss French Renaissance exploration and travel writing (Verrazano, Cartier, Thevet, Léry, Lescarbot, Christine de Pizan, Montaigne) and artists/cartographers (Leonard de Vinci, Michel Angelo Dürer, Alberti). We will read about the influences of 17th and 18th century mapmakers (Champlain, Finé, Roccoco and Baroque art/maps) through diaries of Hennepin, Nicollet, Champlain, la Carte du tendre. The 19th century will bring many diaries and maps from utopian discourse (Villemart, Gustave Raulin, Charles-Albert Gauthier) to romantic travels (Victor Hugo, Jules Vernes). The study of contemporary diaries (Ruffin, Le Clezio, Amélie Nothomb and Sophie Calle) and their maps of the world will be studied through discussion and will show the changing dynamics of identity and the other in the Modern world. Taught in French. Offered occasionally. (4 credits) These concepts and ideas will be debated through the study of journals, maps, and philosophical and literary texts of the time. Students will visit the Ford Library, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center for studies of maps, their philosophical concepts (Aristotle, Plato, Erasmus, Machievelli, Descartes, Kant, Foucault, Didi-Huberman, Jean Luc Nancy, Greenblatt, Onfray) and their conceptualizations from late Sixteenth century to present.';

Political geography offers concepts and approaches to help us think through the complex intersections of people, place, and politics that constitute the struggle to create and maintain nation-states. Thus the first part of the course is devoted to enhancing your understanding of core concepts, such as nation, state, territory, sovereignty, scale, borders, and geographical imagination. The ultimate purpose of this first part of the course then is to assemble a framework for understanding why our contemporary organization of territory throughout the world looks the way it does. Equipped with these foundations, we explore topics in the second part of class that help you think critically about the stability of nations and the organization of territory into the nation-state system as well as challenges to these institutions. Toward this end, you will also conduct an independent research project on a single group\'s attempt to create a nation-state.

Many museums see themselves as the authorities on the proper storage, maintenance, and care of sacred items or cultural objects, while American Indian nations argue that the impositions of museum collectors and curators fail to acknowledge indigenous traditions and belief systems. We will investigate how American Indians work to regain control of sacred objects and, in turn, regain control of their history and the historical narrative through the repatriation of stolen items and objects, the implementation of decolonization practices in museums, and the growth of tribal museums. This course combines scholarly research and readings with field trips to exhibits at several local museums, including “Renewing What They Gave Us: Native American Artists in Residence” at the Minnesota History Center, the “Native American Exhibition” at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and a curator-led exploration at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Enrollment is limited in order to facilitate these trips.';
descCRN['crs30376'] = 'Notes:<br/>This course covers the historical context for resource conflict in Africa. Students will consider present resource exploitation in connection to the more recent historical eras of: the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, “legitimate commerce,” colonialism and neo-colonialism. They will also learn about the role of Africa’s resources as essential to western prosperity. This course will address the ethical, social, and environmental implications of the system of extraction and the resulting violence that is inevitably one of the most common and most severe consequences of it. While all resources will be briefly considered and minerals such as, coltan (columbite-tantalite) and cobalt and platinum in areas such as west-central Africa (the Congos, Zambia) and southern Africa will be addressed, special attention will go to diamonds and oil and the particular mining and drilling industries in those areas. This course will intertwine historical sources, films and literature about the history of resource extraction in Africa with current journal and newspaper articles that document these continuing realities. Readings will come from journal articles, primary sources and the following texts: The New Scramble for Africa, Padraig Carmody; Warfare in Independent Africa, Will Reno, 2011; The New Kings of Crude: China, India and the Global Struggle for Oil, Luke Patey, 2014; Stones of Contention, Todd Cleveland, 2014; Being Nuclear: Africans and the Global Uranium Trade, Gabrielle Hecht 2012; Colonial Extractions: Race and Canadian Mining in Contemporary Africa, Paula Butler, 2015.';

We will look specifically at U.S. involvement in the Philippines and Viet Nam from 1898 to 1975 as moments of military occupation and cultural domination, as well as turning points for U.S. nation-building. What is "imperialism" and how is it different from "hegemony"? How did U.S. imperial adventures in Asia help to recreate a Western geographic imaginary of the "East"? How did they reshape or reconfigure "American" positions and identities? Under what circumstances were former imperial subjects allowed to generate racialized communities? To what extent are memories of U.S. conflicts in Asia cultivated, proliferated, twisted, or suppressed? What lessons can be garnered for the contemporary historical moment?

One of the most significant trends of the current era has been globalization: the shrinking of distances, the greater interpenetration of the world\'s peoples, and the rise, perhaps, of a so-called global culture. Yet it is too simple to say, "it\'s all a big mix," for the questions of how the mixing is done, and who mixes, are complex. The study of literature illuminates these questions. By reading important recent texts, this course tackles "world" questions: what does it mean to be from a certain place? what is a culture? and who are we in it? We\'ll work to link our own personal readings with the texts in dialogue with the world. Texts will be drawn from U.S. multicultural, "world," and travel literature, and rich theoretical readings.

In 1839, Daguerre’s invention was presented as “a free gift to the world.” This course will look at how that gift has been put to use in photographic cultures around the world in contexts as diverse as portrait studios in Yogyakarta, a history museum in Vietnam, French advertising, Soviet family albums and news imagery circulating worldwide. While we will pay careful attention to visual aesthetics, we will focus on photography as a documentary genre that has long been central to how individuals imagine the world beyond their experience. We will also be considering personal photographic archives such as family albums and scrapbooks and asking when private photographs become public representations. One central feature of the course will be learning about how scholars have thought about and through photography and discussing the complications of applying these theories transhistorically and cross-culturally. (Berger, Barthes, Benjamin, Sontag, Sekula, Strassler, Pinney, Tagg, Azoulay) Topics for discussion include debates around truth in photography and the politics of representation, photography’s relationship to history and changing institutional uses of photography, as well as different photographic cultures and their anthropological and sociological significance.

Renaissance scientific methodology, however, led European travelers to meticulously document each New World encounter in writing and develop new tools with which to navigate and represent space, devices that subsequently became weapons of colonial domination. But as Nature and indigenous populations refused to be subjected to European epistemology, failure and disaster were frequent events: shipwrecks left Old World survivors stranded among unknown lands and peoples in the Americas; Amerindians rejected the imposition of a foreign culture and religion, murdering colonists and missionaries; Africans rebelled against slavery and escaped to mountains and jungles to form autonomous communities. An examination of maps, exploration logs, missionary histories, travel literature, historiography and colonial documents will provide the foundation for this course on the ambivalent reality of the Old World\'s encounter with the Americas, in which Europeans were often the losers.
