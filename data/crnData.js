descCRN['10001&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />The main objectives of this introductory course are: to explore the historical construction of racial categories in the United States; to understand the systemic impact of racism on contemporary social processes; to consider popular views about race in the light of emerging scholarship in the field; and to develop an ability to connect personal experiences to larger, collective realities. We will engage several questions as a group: What are the historical and sociological foundations of racial categories? When does focusing on race make someone racist? What is white privilege, and why does it matter? All students will be asked to think and write about their own racial identity. This course, or its equivalent, is required for majors and minors.

We will investigate our own personal cognitive maps and social locations, including our complicity in dominant spatial and racial logics. Lectures, assignments, and activities encourage an understanding of the creation and on-going production of space and scale, and develop insight into racialized communities and identities as sites of conflict, struggle, and potential solidarity rather than fixed categories of representation or consumption. A segment of the course will focus on St. Paul and the impact of the Vietnam War, looking particularly at the construction of Hmong and other Southeast Asian American communities and identities. This course requires prior exposure to at least one of the following areas: American Studies, human geography, sociology of race/ethnicity, or urban studies.</p>';

Expressions of historic memory occur in popular historical forms like community celebrations, archival collections, commemorative sites, family reunions, museum exhibits, and even video games, among many others. In this course, students learn about the ways that Public History is practiced, the rationales for undertaking this study, and the skills available to them in meeting their goals.<br/> <br/>With the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture during the past year, the Public History of African Americans has attracted sustained attention in the popular press, in museum circles, and in academic disciplines.   In this course, students will examine the theory and practice of Public History, including museum work, archives, public memory, and oral history. They will then proceed to consider how African American History has been presented (or omitted) from the larger narrative of North American/U.S. History. The course will include an examination of the politics of creating and building the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) and the interpretive dimensions of presenting that History to the wider public.<br/><br/>Participants must commit to a four-day field trip to Washington, D.C. during fall break and to some outside of class, on-site activities during the semester.</p>';

Hillel opined, “The shy one cannot learn, and the impatient one cannot teach.” Cultures ancient and modern have reflected on the responsibilities of teachers and students, and grappled with what constitutes an effective teacher or a successful student. What are the virtues—and perils—of discipleship? Of charisma? Should a teacher be gentle or forceful? Strict or lenient? Are teachers creators or conduits of tradition? This seminar will explore these questions in a range of contexts, Chinese and Western, historical and modern. Genres studied will include literature and film, as well as philosophical and religious texts.</p>';

descCRN['10064&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ART 294-01* The development of art and identities in China over the last 400 years  has been, literally, revolutionary. This class explores the inherent relationship between material practices and shifting subjectivities, that is the resonance between the physical external world and internal, thinking subject. During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation.  Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses. In the process, we will complicate notions of “Chinese” art and “Chinese” identity in Asia and on the global stage.</p>';

descCRN['10211&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Our common vocabulary of love presents it as a force that strikes and knocks down its victims. It comes like a fever and it disables cognition. Lovers "fall," they are "smitten," "head over heels," "crazy" for each other. Love is both mania and obsession, both a euphoria that alters one\'s view of the world as a whole and an exclusion of the whole world, a radical narrowing of our normally capacious imaginative and perceptual faculties down to the simplest and smallest of human frames: a face, or the sound of a voice. For American authors of the 18th and 19th century, love and madness were twinned sites of altered consciousness that represented the radical "others" of Enlightenment reason, psychic parallels to and extensions of the wilds of the New World and the uncontrollable crowds and freedoms of the new democracy. This course will examine love and madness from multiple perspectives, including the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment, gender and sexuality, the American Gothic, violence, and sin.

Thus, if we want to craft effective solutions to issues such as ocean acidification, air pollution, or climate change, we must start with the human behaviors that lead to them. We will cover psychological principles, theories, and methods and explore the complex web of factors underlying environmentally sustainable and unsustainable actions. A strong theme throughout the semester is the intersection of identity - personal, social, and cultural - and environmentalism.  We will explore questions such as, "Why do some groups of people feel a part of the sustainability movement while others feel alienated from it or skeptical of it?"; "Who takes action on behalf of the natural environment, under what circumstances, and why?"; and "How can we create contexts that promote true sustainability?" Psychology of Sustainable Behavior is a project-based class with a strong civic engagement component.

Course readings focus on suburbs, which are the dominant mode of metropolitan living in contemporary America. We will consider the history of suburbanization, the political economy of growth in the suburbs, the rise of smart growth strategies, and other attempts to foster change in the suburban experience (including the New Urbanism, green building and green movements, and regionalism). We will also consider how suburbs are now experiencing demographic changes and investigate the struggle for community in historic and contemporary suburbs. This seminar will thus complicate the conventional narrative of suburbs as sprawling, inauthentic and homogeneous places. Students will further enrich their understanding of issues covered in the course by conducting original research that examines ways in which American suburbs are changing and/or remaining the same despite efforts to the contrary.

By the 1960s, this area of inquiry was referred to variously as "human ecology." Over the last decade, certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as "political ecology." The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts.

Beyond agriculture, we will also examine other sectoral issues in relation to agriculture or as stand alone environmental concerns. These themes include: human population growth, consumption, biodiversity, climate change, and environmental health. We will be trying on a number of theoretical lenses from geography’s broad human-environment tradition (such as physical geography, cultural ecology, commodity chain analysis, political ecology, resource geography, the human dimensions of global change, hazards geography and environmental justice). In other words, I not only want us to explore a range of environmental issues, but also to grapple with theory and how this informs our understanding of the human-environment interface.

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Writing in an age when religious belief had lost credence as a foundation for ethics, Nietzsche and Freud confronted the groundlessness of value systems while recognizing the impossibility of living without them. Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics - along with brute force - to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence. What will emerge for students is a complex, heterogeneous vision of the conquest and early colonization in which non-European voices speak loudly on their own behalf. <br/>Cross-listed with Latin American Studies 415 and International Studies 415.

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others. By placing these systems in an appropriate historical context, we will identify and analyze key elements, biases and influences that shape the disciplines of History and World Religions.</p>';

In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate how human societies in the pre-modern world developed different sorts of technologies to confront and adapt to the challenges presented by their environments. Drawing upon a diverse array of sources, including glacial ice core data and saints’ lives, we will explore how human technologies changed local environments in both intended and unintended ways. Environmental consequences presented new challenges that required further technological adaptation, fundamentally shaping trajectories of societal development from classical China to medieval Europe, from ancient Oceania to the Americas. In studying the formative relationship between technology and the environment in pre-modern global contexts, we will arrive at a more informed understanding of the emergence of the modern world. For our purposes in this course, “technology” will include not only physical tools but also political-cultural ideologies, systems of government, religions, scientific theories, and techniques of domestication. “Environment” will similarly be defined broadly: climate, physical geography, biosphere, and urban settlements.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine a diversity of historical artifacts, literary texts, and artistic works that engage with Arthurian lore. We will approach each instance of such “Arthuriana” as a construct particular to its own time and place of production. Indeed, like most classics, the Arthurian legend endures not because of the allure of its original form but because of its fundamental adaptability. Camelot was, is, and will continue to be a stage on which societies play out their hopes, fears, and everything in between. Our goal, therefore, will be to illuminate and understand how contemporary social, cultural, and political agendas have shaped and, in turn, have been shaped by each compelling incarnation of Arthur’s court. Course topics will span the gamut of Arthurian tradition: from medieval Welsh folklore re-imagining the post-Roman “Dark Ages” to T.H.

In this course we will journey back to the period of the "Scientific Revolution" to investigate how and why people began to distinguish sharply between the three systems. Who lost, and who profited, from this transition? What similarities between religion, magic and science persisted? To understand this turning point, we will compare contemporaneous cases of individuals who practiced magic, science and religion and ran afoul of authorities. Their trials highlight how the three spheres began to diverge. Cases we will consider might include the 1633 trial of Galileo, and the 1663 witchcraft trial of Tempel Anneke in Germany.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence. What will emerge for students is a complex, heterogeneous vision of the conquest and early colonization in which non-European voices speak loudly on their own behalf.

descCRN['10443&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Although all humans are born with the capacity to learn the sounds of any language, part of learning our native language is learning to categorize sounds into groups specific to that language, thereby filtering out many of the actual phonetic distinctions and concentrating only on those that are important. Just as we, as English speakers, may have trouble hearing the difference between the voiced and voiceless click consonants in Zulu, so speakers of other languages may not hear the difference between the vowels in "beat" and "bit," because this small distinction isn\'t important in their language. Phonology is the study of how different languages organize sounds into perceptual categories. In this class we will look at data from a wide variety of different languages, as well as from several dialects of English, including children\'s acquisition of a phonological system.

While media are central to the continued production of a sense of "the world" at large or the "global" scale, media industries are situated geographically, culturally and institutionally.  Even if they promise worldwide coverage or are multinational companies, there is much to be gained from studying how media are produced and distributed differently according to specific social, political, economic and historical conditions.

The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design.

descCRN['10460&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with GERM 279-01; taught in English*<br/>For thousands of years value has been scrutinized in philosophy, art history, and economic analysis, as it cuts across three constitutive aspects of social, cultural, and political life: economy, aesthetics, and ethics. Not only do we have and impose on the world our moral, aesthetic, and exchange values, but these three fields often become difficult to distinguish, as is evident in the slippery flexibility of words that allow us to say as much “this painting is bad or worthless” as “I think this person is bad or worthless,” or “this is a bad, or worthless, remark” and “this is a bad or worthless check.” This course will focus primarily on influential accounts of value in aesthetic theory, while also examining the ways in which aesthetic value demarcates itself from or implicates its moral and economic counterparts, and what the interplays among the three fields entail for aesthetic value. Our readings will focus on the impact of primarily German thought on the formation of modern aesthetic theory—from the early eighteenth century through the Enlightenment and Romanticism to high modernism and the Frankfurt School.<br/>Class and readings in English.

descCRN['10469&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Prerequisite MUSI 113 OR permission of instructor*<br/>This course traces the development of Western art music from its beginnings in the monophonic chant of early Christianity, through the development of polyphonic genres in the Renaissance (mass, motet, madrigal), to the emergence of opera in Italy around 1600 and the stylistic revolution that we now call the Baroque (including musical life in the extravagant court of Louis XIV in France and Johann Sebastian Bach’s masterful synthesis of Baroque styles), to the sophisticated, multi-movement sonata structures of late 18th century Viennese classicism. Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students’ abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students’ retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary. (4 credits)</p>';

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Writing in an age when religious belief had lost credence as a foundation for ethics, Nietzsche and Freud confronted the groundlessness of value systems while recognizing the impossibility of living without them. Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

descCRN['10592&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with AMST 203-01*<br/>Americans, at least since the Founding era, have cherished the ideal of political equality.  Unlike European nations, the United States did not inherit economic class distinctions from a feudal past. But time and again, American social reformers and mass movements have highlighted inconsistencies between the value of equality and the actual practice of democracy. Through the extension of rights to citizens who were previously excluded or treated as second-class citizens, such as women and African Americans, the polity has become more inclusive. But over the last three decades American citizens have grown increasingly unequal in terms of income and wealth.  The central question posed by this course is the implications of such vast economic inequality for American democracy. Do these disparities between citizens curtail, limit, and perhaps threaten the functioning of genuinely representative governance?  In this course will 1) Explore what other social scientists, mostly economists and sociologists, know about contemporary inequality, particularly in terms of its causes, manifestation, and socio-economic effects; 2) Consider the concept of inequality in political theory and in American political thought, and; 3) Examine the current relationship between economic inequality and each of three major aspects of the American political  system: political voice, representation, and public policy.

This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question "how we should live our lives as individuals" and "how we should live together in peace and justice" late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, "the people," nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day.<br/><br/>The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi. To the extent that they shed light on late medieval thought, we will also touch on classical political theorists such as Aristotle and Cicero as well as Muslim and Jewish thinkers such as ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rusd.

We will then turn to cognitive psychology to describe the mental and emotional processes that underlie the judgments and decisions we make when faced with data vs. personal experience. We will also explore social psychological theories and studies that help explain why people deny climate change even in places where its impacts are likely to be severe.

This course covers definitive works of the most important authors of Russia’s Golden Age, namely Pushkin’s Byronic novel in verse, Eugene Onegin; Lermontov’s novella of an ironic anti-hero, A Hero of Our Time; Gogol’s absurdist and hilarious novellas The Nose and The Overcoat; Turgenev’s exposition of intergenerational and ideological conflict, Fathers and Sons; Dostoevsky’s most famous novel Crime and Punishment, a thrilling “why-dun-it” with a sympathetic axe-murderer; and Tolstoy’s masterpiece Anna Karenina, a morality tale of adultery and self-determination. The course will introduce students to the art of literary criticism through an examination of the literary aspects of these classic works. The course will also include discussions about Russian culture and history as well as universal questions regarding the self, society and the state, freedom of choice, the existence of God, and other daunting questions about human existence.

Wright Mills dscribed it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples\' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization.

The course focuses on Trump’s rise as the most visible example of the rise of rise of right wing populism, but will also use some comparative material to examine similar right-wing populist insurgencies in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. We will explore the debates of how best to explain populism, reading material from a variety of disciplines. Along the way, we will address questions such as: What is populism and how do we study it? What distinguishes populists from traditional political elites? What social forces produce populism and can they account for how populist movements have varied over time? Is populism always a right wing phenomenon associated with xenophobia, racism, and sexism or can a left-wing, progressive populism be a constructive force of social change? In answering these questions, we will critically assess popular explanations for Trump’s rise, including arguments about the idea of “white rage,” the rebellion of the white working class, and the emasculation of men.</p>';
descCRN['10666&TermDescription=Fall%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only*<br/>As Frederick Rudolf aptly noted, the history of American education "is American history" and reveals "the central purposes and driving directions of American society." The advent of mass schooling represents a profound exercise in collective self-definition. As with much else in a democracy, deciding whom to teach, what to teach, and how to teach have been subjects of lively debate in the US from the early nineteenth century to the dawning of the twenty-first. This course offers a broad overview of the overarching political controversies durrounding the historical development of public schooling in America. We begin with a survey of 19th-century movements to define elementary schooling as the chosen instrument for nation-building, for safeguarding democratic self-governance, and for resolving with the cascading social disorders implicated in the rise of urbanization, mass immigration, and industrial capitalism. The rise of high schools in the early twentieth century is the second major topic of interest, and more specifically, progressive-era debates about the relationship between public schools and colleges and universities. This era begets the great ideological fault-lines underlying educational theory and practice in the US that lasted the 20th century into the 21st. The dramatic post-war reconstruction of public schooling is the third major focus of the course. We explore the proliferation of federal government mandates to secularize, integrate, assimilate, equalize, multiculturalize, and expunge racism and sexism from the curriculum, all the while raising academic standards for all. With these directivescame vastly expanded government funding for social science research trained on evaluating public schools\' efforts to realize these new benchmarks of educational progress. We observe this rebirth of the social sciences as arbiters of educational policy debates. The final section of the course revolves around contemporary disputes over school choice policies and the federal No-Child-Left-Behind initiatives. These latest campaigns to democratize academic excellence have followed a familiar, recurring script of US policy making since the 1980s: deregulation, de-centralization, consumer choice, managerial and administrative prerogatives in public agencies re-invented in the image of governance in the corporate sector, and the elaboration of benchmarks to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of educational practices. We consider how recent experience indicate limitations to privatization, corporatization, and marketization as solutions to the educational crisis, and perhaps, suggest the beginnings of a renewed search for answers to the riddle of public education.</p>';

Then I discovered that the immigrants were American History” (Oscar Handling, 1951:3). Over the course of the last five centuries, millions of people, young and old, male and female, married and single, left their homelands to seek a better life. Originating in different localities, they escaped famine and hunger, war, religious persecution and intolerance, colonialism, and revolutionary turmoil. Some left following their “adventurous” spirit. While many died before reaping the benefits of their life transforming quest, others survived to build a new nation. While all contributed to building the country, not all left a written account of their experiences. Who were these people who, willingly or forcibly, left all they knew behind? What were they escaping from? What were their dreams? Hardships? How were they received by those who, by pure accident of history, had arrived before them?<br/><br/>This class is an expedition into the past with an eye on the present, examining firsthand accounts left by immigrants and about them. What does an 18th century Scottish indentured servant may have in common with a 21st century migrant farm worker? What does a turn of the 20th century Polish immigrant might have in common with a 21st century Arab immigrant? What does a Japanese picture bride might share with a contemporary Russian bride? Delving into divergent historical periods and differing groups, the goal is to develop a better understanding of parallels and variations, hopes and dreams, the ease and challenges that immigrants have experienced, and continue to face.</p>';

In this course, we adopt a sociological lens to examine the systematic operation of class divisions through cultural mediums, considering how class identities become formulated and class cultures become differentiated within varying institutional contexts. Our study will track the category of class along multiple lines of cultural distinction, examining class subjectivity as it is constructed in relation to gender, race, and sexual identity, and as it is built around moral discourses of difference and symbolic economies of style, taste, and preference.</p>';

Not only do we have and impose on the world our moral, aesthetic, and exchange values, but these three fields often become difficult to distinguish, as is evident in the slippery flexibility of words that allow us to say as much “this painting is bad or worthless” as “I think this person is bad or worthless,” or “this is a bad, or worthless, remark” and “this is a bad or worthless check.” This course will focus primarily on influential accounts of value in aesthetic theory, while also examining the ways in which aesthetic value demarcates itself from or implicates its moral and economic counterparts, and what the interplays among the three fields entail for aesthetic value.

In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate how human societies in the pre-modern world developed different sorts of technologies to confront and adapt to the challenges presented by their environments. Drawing upon a diverse array of sources, including glacial ice core data and saints’ lives, we will explore how human technologies changed local environments in both intended and unintended ways. Environmental consequences presented new challenges that required further technological adaptation, fundamentally shaping trajectories of societal development from classical China to medieval Europe, from ancient Oceania to the Americas. In studying the formative relationship between technology and the environment in pre-modern global contexts, we will arrive at a more informed understanding of the emergence of the modern world. For our purposes in this course, “technology” will include not only physical tools but also political-cultural ideologies, systems of government, religions, scientific theories, and techniques of domestication. “Environment” will similarly be defined broadly: climate, physical geography, biosphere, and urban settlements. This course fulfills the global and/or comparative history as well as the pre-1800 requirements for the history major.</p>';

These two empires were bound together by shared space, common interests, and episodic distrust. They were Frenemies. The sources for this study are Byzantine and Islamic histories from the period, together with critical analysis of those sources. In addition and importantly the literature and art these two empires produced provide vital and illuminating sight into these bodies, including their view of one another.

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others. By placing these systems in an appropriate historical context, we will identify and analyze key elements, biases and influences that shape the disciplines of History and World Religions.</p>';

Of course, we know their stories only second hand.  This course explores how narratives about martyrs ("martyrologies") relate to the formation of religious identities and communities.  Over the course of the semester, we will analyze martyrologies from the early Christian and Jewish periods, the beginnings of Islam, the sixteenth century, and modernity. We will pay special attention to the social and political contexts with which martyrs often found themselves at odds (including the Roman Empire in the ancient past, and the U.S./Middle East conflicts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries).  In class discussions, readings, and written work, you will have the opportunity to reflect on the following questions (among others): How do the stories we tell about martyrs shape the way we understand religious practices and beliefs?  How do narratives of bearing witness, suffering, and death help to illumine relationships between religious and political domains?  How might our current understanding of martyrdom be informed for better and for worse by a study of history?</p>';

With these changes, new narratives emerged that we continue to see even in today\'s culture. They asked questions such as: why do two people fall in love? Why does an individual strive for a better social standing? Is empathy possible in a capitalist society? The answers to these questions are complex, and often relate to what is known as "mimetic desire," a term coined by French theorist Rene Girard in his book Deceit, Desire and the Novel (Le mensonge romantique et la verite romanesque). We will examine the relationships of deceit and desire to money and the marketplace in 19th-century France, and, in the process, learn more about our own society. This course offers a survey of 19th century French literature (novels, plays, short stories, and poetry) linked to the theme of the course, including works by Audouard, Balzac, Desbordes-Valmore, Flaubert, Hugo, Sand, Zola, and others.

descCRN['30006&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />In the summer of 1989, the economist Julian Simon and the ecologist Garret Hardin faced off in an auditorium at the University of Wisconsin over the fate of the earth. Where Hardin was gloomy about the prospect, predicting that the demands of an increasing population would place natural resources under stress, Simon was unabashedly optimistic, arguing that human ingenuity would find solutions to the problems of human civilization. This course critiques both these sets of ideas, within an analytical framework that draws on anthropology, history and politics. The relationship of human populations to their environment is mediated by their culture, which shapes how, how much, and what we consume. Although human ingenuity can find technical solutions to the problems that face us, technology itself is ordered, managed and utilized by social and political systems. The trajectory of human societies throughout history is to become, politically, economically, and socially, increasingly complex over time, which in turn shapes how technology is developed and deployed to transform nature and help reproduce society. However, we live in a world that is more tightly integrated than ever before, which makes environmental stresses that were once localized in their impact into global problems, even as the complexity of our social and political organization, both locally and globally, militates against easy solutions.<br/> <br/>The emergence of agriculture led to the development of centralized political systems and to an exponential increase in the human population, and eventually to an economic system based on perpetual growth requiring in turn a cultural-ideological system to generate a constant expansion of wants. By examining four inter-related factors that have shaped our modern condition—the rise of states, population growth, industrial food systems and the emergence of a ‘culture of consumption’—this course introduces students to a model through which to understand the modern world as an integrated whole based on inter-locking economic, political and socio-cultural systems. Given the tremendous stress placed on the environment by the operation of the global system—which has led in recent years to the development of the notion of the anthropocene, which argues that human beings do not merely impact the environment but are a geological force that changes the way the earth system works — can the world political and economic order endure in its present configuration? How might its transformation be achieved and what might that transformation look like? This course promises no answers, but will raise crucial and complex questions, and introduce students to a way of thinking synthetically and holistically (i.e, anthropologically) about them.</p>';

Using a sustainable development framework this course emphasizes the linkages between human and physical landscapes through the evaluation of landuse and community change in rural areas throughout the US. We will explore the implications of demographic (including migration and immigration), economic, cultural, and environmental changes for rural environs using several case studies from across the US and Western Europe, including an overnight field trip to northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Rural community strategies for adapting to and accommodating competing demands for water and landuse will be considered, including pressure for new housing developments, recreation opportunities (boating, fishing, hiking, biking), and conservation needs. Students will be exposed to theoretical and empirical approaches to rural development in different regional contexts, as well as problems associated with these development paradigms.

By 2010, the urban population in the Asia-Pacific region has surpassed the population of the United States and the European Union combined.  In this course, we will focus on cities in East, Southeast and South Asia. We will first contextualize the rapid urbanization in the region’s changing political economy, and identify urban issues that are unique to this region. We will further explore different theoretical approaches to understand Asian cities; several of them challenge mainstream urban theories rooted in the experiences of West European and North American cities.

In a sense, you will be studying yourself, since you are a prime example of a language user. Most of your knowledge of language, however, is unconscious, and the part of language that you can describe is largely the result of your earlier education, which may have given you confused, confusing, or misleading notions about language. This course is intended to clarify your ideas about language and bring you to a better understanding of its nature. By the end of the course you should be familiar with some of the terminology and techniques of linguistic analysis and be able to apply this knowledge to the description of different languages.

The English written by Chaucer 600 years ago is now very difficult to understand without annotation, not to mention anything written a few centuries before that. This course investigates the nature of language change, how to determine a language\'s history, its relationship to other languages and the search for common ancestors or "proto-languages." We will discuss changes at various linguistic levels: sound change, lexical change, syntactic change and changes in word meaning over time. Although much of the work done in this field involves Indo-European languages, we will also look at change in many other language families. This is a practical course, most of class time will be spent DOING historical linguistics, rather than talking about it. We will be looking at data sets from many different languages and trying to make sense of them. In the cases where we have examples of many related languages, we will try to reconstruct what the parent language must have looked like. (4 credits)</p>';

Biological properties of the human ear, pharynx, larynx, tongue, and lung impose limits on the sounds of human languages, which can be studied from both a biological and an acoustic point of view. In this course you will be trained to produce and recognize (almost) all the sounds which human languages make use of, and to develop a systematic way of analyzing and recording them. Since sounds are perceived as well as produced, you will also be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech, learning how acoustic signals of frequency, amplitude, and duration are translated into visible, quantifiable images. You will learn the art of decoding these spectrograms into sounds and words and sentences. The linguistics laboratory contains several different programs for practicing and listening to sounds from many of the world\'s languages. This course is recommended for students of foreign languages, drama, music and anyone who wants to become more aware of their (and other people\'s) pronunciation. (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN['30048&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />We are living in the midst of an "irony epidemic," where two of the most frequently used expressions in current American English are "like" and "whatever." Both of these are literally advertisements that words are not the real thing (at best, they are "like" it), and that they don\'t matter (since "whatever" you say is equally a matter of indifference). This course takes as its point of departure the sarcasm and irony in spoken American English, and proceeds to an investigation of how the peculiar message of sarcasm ("I don\'t mean this") is conveyed in other languages, and in the media. Not surprisingly, the study of cheap talk connects intimately with aspects of pop culture. More surprising, however, is the idea that the cheapness of talk is not only a currently recognized property of our language, but that it might serve to define the very essence of human language in general and offer insights into the origins and nature of our ability to speak at all.

Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture. As humans, we judge each other constantly on the basis of the way we talk, we make sweeping generalizations about people\'s values and moral worth solely on the basis of the language they speak. Diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. If someone criticizes our language we feel they are criticizing our inmost self. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who speak differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity. (4 credits)<br/></p>';

The course will focus on U.S. identities in relation to age, race, gender, sexuality, and class in contexts of experimentation and speculation, including speculative fiction and futurism. The texts in this course, although all are “American,” explore what it means to give voice to many differences within a national identity, particularly for young people and for girls and women of color. What literary forms best suit an exploration and representation of such identities? How do our authors stretch received forms so as to accommodate the content of their characters’ lives? We will study works by Toni Morrison, Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, Sherman Alexie, Louise Erdrich, Tim O’Brien, and Octavia Butler, among others. Course requirements include: an in-class oral presentation, a brief written response to each primary reading, and three essays of about 5-7 pages each (one of which must be revised).

descCRN['30220&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />It is entirely possible for one to discuss the meanings of most texts—their themes, morals, historical significances, and so on—without paying much attention to the formal and linguistic elements that produce such meanings. Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously poeticizes the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up these and other questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, the type of knowledge (and ignorance) that poetry may or may not offer, even the question of what poetry is. Readings will draw from British and American lyric poetry in its different sub-genres (e.g. sonnet, elegy, ode, dramatic monologue, lyrical ballad).

You may have heard that less than two weeks ago, the cast of the hit musical Hamilton, on Broadway, delivered an address directly to VP-elect Mike Pence, who was in the audience that night. Suddenly, every news outlet was talking about whether this was "appropriate" or not. People throughout the history of theater will tell you: theater has always been political. It has been a means of offering public commentary, challenging or upholding norms, voicing a protest, or offering an alternative view that presents a world the writers would prefer to live in. In ENGL 136, we will read plays--both classic and modern--as literary texts and talk about the craft that went into their writing. But we will also take field trips to see several plays at different theaters in Minneapolis and St. Paul; we will study theater reviews and write some of our own; we will meet people who work on technical aspects of productions (like lighting and costumes) and learn about the craft of building productions; and we will think, talk, and write about the relationship between the dramatic arts and current events. As part of our larger goal of putting theater in context, the "current" events we study will include Renaissance debates about kingship and property when we read William Shakespeare, and nineteenth-century debates about the proper place of women when we read Susan Glaspell.</p>';

In this course, we will pay particular attention to how literary texts can illuminate relationships between place and the political. We will ask, for instance, how twentieth-century British and Irish texts suggest interactions between built environments (e.g. museums, estate houses, or operating rooms) and processes of social and political change (e.g. world wars, revolution, mass protest, or the rise of the welfare state). We will also ask, in a related manner, how texts illuminate natural spaces (e.g. bogs, rivers, or islands) as politicized, from providing sites of nostalgia and romance to offering metaphors for civilization and the primitive.

We will explore the longstanding project of writing an African American self as both a literary and a political subject. We will read closely, critically, and appreciatively from multiple genres, including poetry, slave narratives, short stories, essays, novels, and a memoir. We will supplement our exploration of those texts with critical and theoretical readings. Among the themes that will organize the course are: writing as a political act; generic innovation and subversion; representations of gendered and classed experiences of blackness in the United States; aesthetic innovation in relation to political and social change; an ongoing vernacular and/or oral tradition within African American arts and letters; the politics of audience; and the limits of literary representation itself. Requirements include: two papers of about 10 pages each, brief response papers to each new reading, an in-class presentation, class participation, and a final exam.

descCRN['30238&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />If you’ve taken courses in the humanities, then you’re probably aware of a field that goes by the nickname of “theory.” You may have heard of thinkers such as Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, though chances are you haven’t yet studied how their writings grew out of a common engagement with questions of language and textuality. This course offers you the opportunity to do so. Beginning with Ferdinand de Saussure’s groundbreaking Course in General Linguistics, we’ll trace the development of literary theory through structuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, feminism, queer theory, postcolonial theory, posthumanism, and ecocriticism. Our approach will be to treat literary theory as a field of study in itself (rather than as an assortment of methodologies to apply to works of literature and other cultural texts), and, to that end, we’ll be reading exclusively primary texts from this field—though, if you engage these texts seriously, they will most likely change the way you read just about everything, from poems to images to television shows to text messages. This course will be of interest to all students who wish to learn about literary theory as well as to those who plan to pursue Ph.D. programs in literary studies. Authors include J. L. Austin, Roland Barthes, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Hélène Cixous, Jacques Derrida, Lee Edelman, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Donna Haraway, Luce Irigaray, Roman Jakobson, Jacques Lacan, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Paul de Man, Timothy Morton, Ferdinand de Saussure, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.</p>';
descCRN['30239&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Virginia Woolf famously claimed that “On or about December 1910 human character changed.”  While many changes were underway as the world drifted towards WWI, a revolution was underway in the world of art.  It was in 1910 that London hosted the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition, launching the stars of Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Matisse, and Picasso onto the international stage.  Literary and popular visual culture would be—and remain—intertwined across the 20th century, connections that are taking new and exciting shape in the current century.  This course traces British visual culture and art from the seminal exhibit of 1910 to the present, starting with Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group and concluding with a study of British multiculturalism in novels, poetry, and popular images of resistance (including works by graffiti artist Banksy, Brexit activism, and the Irish Troubles murals).  Students will participate in a painting workshop and read visual/media theory by John Berger, Laura Mulvey, and C.L.R. James.  In addition to studying artists’ books in the special collections library and reading a graphic novel, students will read works of fiction and poetry by writers such as Virginia Woolf, T.S.

descCRN['30241&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First day attendance required* What might you learn about a culture and its history if you focused on a narrow moment of time and then read widely what was published within it? That is the question this course seeks to answer by focusing on the year 1859 in Britain. Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species came out in 1859, igniting enormous controversies in the scientific world. That was also the year that the first sensation novel was published, launching a craze for crime and harrowing fiction. It saw the publication of Tennyson’s Idylls of the King, cementing his reputation and confirming that he had been the right choice for poet laureate in 1850. And it was the year that John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty rubbed shoulders with Samuel Smiles’s Self Help. New periodicals were launched that year, including Dickens’s wildly popular All the Year Round. This course draws its entire reading list from 1859 (including portions of everything mentioned above, and much more), inviting you to delve deeply into the literature, popular culture, science, social commentary, and controversies of the day. It seeks to examine the relationship between politics, novels, innovation, empire, and more, offering a mid-century vision of Victorian culture through multiple media, archival projects, and a reading experience that is designed to help you think about what it would have been like to be alive then, entering into some of these multiple conversations.</p>';

Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we\'ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we\'ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we\'ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we\'ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them.

descCRN['30366&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />Germany has the dubious distinction of having produced one of the most unforgettable “stars” of the twentieth century, Adolf Hitler. By all accounts Hitler possessed a remarkable charisma, and grounded his power in a cult of Persönlichkeit.  But the power of charisma encompasses, of course, many areas of social life, from politics to religion, the military, monarchies, movies and even criminal cases.  In the seminar we will examine various forms in German-speaking cultures of stardom and charisma, defined by Max Weber as “a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman or at least superficially exceptional qualities.” To what extent is charisma "in" an individual and to what extent does it consist of a group\'s projection?  What are the conditions that produce a "star"; why, what and how does s/he signify? Grounding our work in the theoretical propositions of Max Weber (Die Typen der Herrschaft), Sigmund Freud (Massenpsychologie u. Ich-Analyse), we will focus together on a few case studies, but center much of our work on student research that will explore charisma from some angle, such as literature, film, or a real-life persona, and that will culminate in a capstone project and presentation. Open to sophomores and juniors who have completed German 363, 364, 365 or 366; will not preclude the possibility of taking future iteration\'s the Senior Seminar.  Also open to other interested students with the prerequisite knowledge of German and permission of the instructor.   <br/></p>';

Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we\'ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we\'ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we\'ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we\'ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them. Knowing what makes a healthy language, we\'ll look at endangered languages and the connections between linguistic diversity and biodiversity.</p>';

This course calls the popular stereotype into question by focusing on four dramatic case studies of notorious but pivotal mediators who moved between the Spanish, Aztec, English, French, Kongolese and Portuguese empires of the early modern period. Among others, we will consider conflicting primary source accounts and current scholarship about the Dona Marina, the Mexica translator for the Army of Cortes; Nathaniel Courthope, and English profiteer who made a fortune peddling nutmeg between India and New York; two competing French pirates who sacked the South American port city of Cartagena de Indias twice in a single month; and Dona Beatriz, an Kongolese convert to Christianity who was burned at the stake for professing that she was possessed by the spirit of Saint Anthony. This diverse group of pirates, missionaries and translators walked a similar tightrope between worlds, both liberated and constrained by their border crossings. We will evaluate how gender, race, religion, and imperial loyalties affected the survival of this small group of interlopers, and how, in spite of this, they came to disproportionately influence events in the Atlantic world.

It examines the various forms of analysis used by historians through a study of different kinds of historical texts and sources. It provides an opportunity for students to develop the skills and habits of thinking essential to practicing the discipline of history. This course invites students to address some of the myriad questions and controversies that surround such historical concepts as "objectivity," "subjectivity," "truth," "epistemology," and thereby to develop a "philosophy" of history. At the same time, it stresses the acquisition of such historical tools as the use of written, oral, computer and media sources and the development of analytical writing skills. The subject matter for study changes each year. Recent themes of the course have been memory, empires, and class formation. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN['30432&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />In the Plan of Union prepared during the 1754 "Albany Convention," Anglo-American colonists met to consider uniting as a loose confederation for their common defense and to ally with the Iroquois confederacy. That plan failed, but a later experiment in unity succeeded when the united colonies declared independence. Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women\'s rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that "All men are created equal." This course covers the periods of the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the early national and antebellum periods, before concluding with the Civil War. It also considers the global causes and consequences of the war and the rise of the new United States. We will also analyze the construction of the myth and historical memory of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father who has captured the imagination of people in the modern U.S.  Through a study of the recent biography of Hamilton along with the music and stage production of Hamilton, we will consider both the biographical and mythical Alexander Hamilton in order to understand his era and our own.</p>';

These are problems that have preoccupied governments, colonial armies, international organizations, and individual families throughout history. While disease has affected populations from the earliest days of human civilization, doctors and politicians in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries developed new and different ways of governing bodies. This course traces the dramatic shift from a concern about the transmission of infectious diseases to an overriding fear about the “quality and quantity” of families, workers, and soldiers.

Infectious diseases cross borders with little respect for societal hierarchy or political position in the world order. Pandemics have repeatedly challenged the notion of the nation state, religious and political ideology and social structures.   Modern day pandemics have the ability to spread further geographically, reflecting our ever more globalized world. Pandemics can concurrently reflect strong nationalist (almost isolationist) tendencies, alongside growing reliance on a global governance structure. However, they also increasingly reveal society’s marginalized peoples and their limited participation in and attention from government. Through the stories of historical and modern day pandemics, students will explore notions of the state, definitions of society, political and governance structures, and the interactions between people and their self-defined world.</p>';

descCRN['30537&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course provides a survey of Western art music from the early works of Ludwig van Beethoven, composed in the mid-1790s, to the symphonic works of the generation of modernist composers born around 1860 (Gustav Mahler, Jean Sibelius, Giacomo Puccini, Richard Strauss). One principal aim of the course is to expose students to a large quantity of multi-national Western music in a variety of genres and styles, thus leading students to a deeper understanding of the development of musical style in the nineteenth century. In addition to the musical works themselves, and no less importantly, the course stresses the contexts surrounding the musical texts. Lectures address the political, cultural, and intellectual history that directed the path of musical style in this period. Students are therefore expected to become familiar not only with specific works and the stylistic footprints of many composers, but also with the significant cultural-historical events and trends that informed composition during this period--the pan-European revolutions of 1848, the aesthetic ideology of autonomous music, the public music culture of the European bourgeoisie, the relationship between musical reception and various strains of European nationalism, and so on.

The first is to develop the foundational knowledge and conceptual literacy necessary to engage with International Relations\' multidimensional concerns. These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.

It is organized around the following questions: What are the interests motivating US involvement in the Asia-Pacific? What are the challenges to US global and regional interests in the region? How well is the current US policy/strategy working to advance those interests? What realistic military, political, economic and diplomatic options are available to the US in the region? What strategic choices would you advise the Obama administration to make if it is to advance/defend key American interests in the region? <br/>Throughout, seminar participants will approach these questions from the perspective of American policy practitioners seeking to craft a comprehensive strategy that advances US interests in the region and the world.

The theme for this year’s course is inspired by Prince, who left behind him a vast number of unreleased recordings in a vault in his Paisley Park studio.  In this course, we will be exploring writings that were left behind on the desks and in the metaphorical vaults of some 20th century philosophers at the time of their death and which have subsequently been published.  These writings will be Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s The Visible and Invisible (which includes “Working Notes”) and Martin Heidegger’s lecture course The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World, Finitude, Solitude and selections from The Black Notebooks (along with some critical commentary). We will also take up selections from Jacques Derrida’s The Beast and the Sovereign, Part II and his Heidegger: The Question of Being and History, published this past summer and which we will read side-by-side with some passages from Heidegger’s Being and Time.  While will close out the course with an essay of Derrida’s published during his lifetime: “The Eyes of Language: The Abyss and the Volcano,” the question will linger:  What can we learn from reading work that has come to a sudden end about open questions in philosophy, and what it means to ask a philosophical question itself?</p>';

It is clear that understanding attitudes is fundamental for understanding many topics of interest to social scientists—impression formation, group stereotypes, marketing and consumer behavior, jury decision-making, political preferences, and many others. This course will provide an intellectual forum for discussing attitudes and persuasion from a social psychological perspective. Students will use materials from books, scholarly research articles, and video/film clips to explore topics such as attitude formation and structure, self-perception, attitude measurement, ambivalent attitude, the attitude-behavior relationship, attitude change, social influence and persuasion, dissonance, implicit attitude, attitude about groups, and so on.

We focus on the use of the metaphors of enslavement and abolition by advocates of animal welfare, rights, and liberation and by opponents of abortion, associated reproductive technologies, and of the very notion of reproductive freedom. We explore the chain of associations that emerge between religion, slavery, race, humanity, and animality. The “religious unconscious” of this course revolves the fact that all humans as far as we know grapple with the relations among humanity, animality, and divinity. Thus the central thesis of this course is that the racialization of slavery occurred within Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions and that the historical enslavement of people of African descent provides the model for the ethical rhetoric of animal rights advocates and opponents of abortion. Among the questions we explore is the following: how does the appropriation by animal rights and anti-abortion activists of the image of the enslaved black person and the metaphors of slavery and abolition affect our understanding of racialization?</p>';

From there we will move to a survey of the history of encounter and exchange, from the early period (al Biruni), to the establishment of the great Muslim sultanates.  We will critically examine the evidence of religious conflict, alongside the evidence of rich cultural exchange, and interrogate the competing historigrahic narratives, according to which South Asia either become a single Indo-Islamic civilization or a place of two cultures destined to become different modern nation states (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh).

In this course, we apply a sociological perspective to examine the significance of a culture of consumption, paying particular attention to the possibilities for sustainability within a consumption-oriented society. Contextualizing the cultural meanings of consumption within the social forces that shape consumption practices, the course will consider various configurations of consumption in American society, including how consumption structures and reproduces social difference and inequality, the role of consumer practices in the constitution of personal identity, sociability and leisure, the role of marketing and advertising, branding and embodied consumer display, and the location of consumption as a site of sub-cultural resistance. In the context of the study of consumption, we will likewise examine emergent configurations of sustainability, asking how individuals, communities, social groups and organizations in contemporary consumer culture are (differently) defining the pursuit and practice of sustainability through, for instance, anti-consumerism, the green movement, fair trade, “green capitalism,” voluntary simplicity, downshifting, slow living, frugal living, radical consumption and ethical consumption.

And yet, like all concepts, “Nature” has a history and is tied to specific ideas about what it means to be a human. This course studies a central chapter in this history, examining the place and function of the natural world in the Romantic and post-Romantic poetic tradition. In particular, we’ll explore how writers in this tradition interrogate the relation between human beings and the natural world, and we’ll ask how such poetry might open up an understanding of ecology that complicates some of the assumptions underwriting current environmental practices. While we’ll spend the most time with British Romanticism, our readings in poetry will take us across the pond and will span from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. We’ll also examine visual artworks as well as theoretical texts that range from Enlightenment aesthetics and epistemology to current ecocriticism and speculative realist philosophy. Poets include William Blake, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Clare, Percy Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Jean Toomer, Elizabeth Bishop, Mary Oliver, and Louise Glück; prose writers include Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, Raymond Williams, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, Leo Marx, Timothy Morton, Donna Haraway, Jonathan Bate, Lawrence Buell, and Quentin Meillassoux.</p>';

Half of the world’s population now lives in cities, with the most rapid growth happening in the developing world. The globalized urban processes compel us to rethink existing urban theories as well as the very definition of the city. In this seminar, we will explore three strands of scholarly works that expand our knowledge about contemporary global urbanism. The first focuses on the scholarship of neoliberal urbanism, which prioritizes North American and Western European urban experiences and shapes the mainstream thinking of cities. The second consists of on-the-ground variegated contestations, which reveal diverse urban living experiences and propose alternatives to the capitalist urbanization process. Finally, there is the scholarship challenging mainstream urban theories with a different epistemological stance, seeking to re-conceptualize urbanization from the global South. In addition to studying these important ways of thinking about global urbanism, students will conduct individual research projects to develop deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes.

descCRN['30736&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Sophomore standing or permission of instructor required* Why do non-human animals and other beings matter for politics? How do we understand the political subject or the idea of citizenship in an increasingly hybrid and technological world? How do human beings relate to other living and non-living entities? These questions have deep roots. Human beings have defined themselves in relation to animals, plants, gods, and machines for a very long time. In addition, while many claim that they can explain “human nature,” there is a lot of disagreement in science, philosophy, religion, literature, and politics about what this “nature” is. At the same time, ecological and technological change continue to shape our understanding of the interdependence of human, animal, and plant life. Just as social theorists have argued for millennia about the most ethical and harmonious ways to structure human societies, twenty-first century thinkers are asking about what it<br/>means to live in societies comprised of humans, animals, cyborgs, and possible hybrids of these. We will join these thinkers in this project, examining relationships between humans and nonhuman entities from multiple perspectives. Our readings will range from the ancient to very contemporary. Since these questions matter in many parts of social life, we will consider how cinematic, literary, and visual representations of the human and its boundaries relate to the ongoing project of defining who and what matters in politics.<br/></p>';

Created by historians at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, History Harvest is a collaborative, community-based approach to history. The shared experience of giving is at the heart of the History Harvest concept. The project makes invisible histories and materials more visible by working with and within local communities to collect, preserve and share previously unknown or under-appreciated artifacts and stories. Initial "harvests" have taken place in a series of communities across the Great Plains region.  At each “harvest,” community-members are invited to bring and share their letters, photographs, objects and stories, and participate in a conversation about the significance and meaning of their materials. Each artifact is digitally captured and then shared in this free web-based archive for general educational use and study. This class will begin by examining the history of Saint Paul’s Historic African American community, Rondo, which was devastated by the development of highway I-94.  We will also consider the local and national dimensions and consequences of this tragic event. Since the devastation of their physical community, African Americans who once lived in this vibrant neighborhood have been working collectively to make sure Saint Paul remembers this history and that something like this never happens again.  The class will collaborate with community partner, Rondo Avenue, Inc. to implement a History Harvest during spring 2017.  After the History Harvest event students will digitally process all of the artifacts in order to make them available to the wider Saint Paul community.

As early as the sixteenth century Europeans praised China for its meritocratic examination system, delicate porcelain, and elegant gardens. Yet they also reviled China as the home of tyrannical despots. Conversely, Chinese saw in Europe models of liberal education and democracy. But they also denounced imperialist exploitation and aggression. This capstone seminar examines select encounters between China and the West and inquires both how these encounters shaped each culture’s perceptions of the other and how these interactions affected local cultural identities. What ideals and anxieties did Chinese and Europeans project upon one another, and what accounts for the dramatic fluctuations in Chinese and Western views toward one another over time? Fluency in Chinese is required.</p>';

In particular, we’ll explore how writers in this tradition interrogate the relation between human beings and the natural world, and we’ll ask how such poetry might open up an understanding of ecology that complicates some of the assumptions underwriting current environmental practices. While we’ll spend the most time with British Romanticism, our readings in poetry will take us across the pond and will span from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. We’ll also examine visual artworks as well as theoretical texts that range from Enlightenment aesthetics and epistemology to current ecocriticism and speculative realist philosophy. Poets include William Blake, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Clare, Percy Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Jean Toomer, Elizabeth Bishop, Mary Oliver, and Louise Glück; prose writers include Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, Raymond Williams, Geoffrey Hartman, Paul de Man, Leo Marx, Timothy Morton, Donna Haraway, Jonathan Bate, Lawrence Buell, and Quentin Meillassoux.</p>';

descCRN['30776&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />When the AIDS epidemic permeated American culture in the 1980s, some Christian churches were quick to describe the disease as God’s judgement on the gay community. Yet a counter-narrative emerged from gay Christians that used theological language to affirm their own lives in the midst of immense suffering and condemnation. This course looks at religious rhetoric from the height of the 1980s AIDS epidemic in the U.S., examining how it was used to both stigmatize and resist stigma and asking how discourse and rhetoric affect the subjectivity of individuals and communities. Theoretically, Michel Foucault provides the framework for the course, and participants will read foundational works by Foucault before turning to analyze religious texts -- both written and visual -- from this period.</p>';

But what happens when we add gender to this mix? What are the different roles that women take on in social movements and how can we account for differences across movements? How do gender, race, and class intersect in social movements? For example, what happens when we compare the ideas of progress in Black Lives Matter and white nationalist movements with particular emphasis on women’s place(s) in the future? In this course, we scrutinize the intersections of race, class, and gender as they relate to the ideals to which movements aspire. Social movements that emphasize concepts such as progress, development, and nation-making indicate visions of the future that can illuminate how gender, race, and class shape peoples’ lives. We will focus on the experiences of women (as individuals and as members of groups or organizations) in their historical and structural locations and explore what concepts such as progress, development, and nation-making mean for women in the struggle over feminist meanings and claims.</p>';
descCRN['30778&TermDescription=Spring%202017'] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course examines the growth of and changes in neoliberalism from the 20 th century to today. Who or what is a neoliberal? What is “neo” about neoliberalism? What changes has neoliberalism brought about and how have these changes affected how we approach questions concerning poverty and international development? Often, people examine neoliberalism as a form of governance—that is, as a means to allocate the power to make decisions and establishment of the criteria on which decisions are judged. From this perspective, neoliberalism rearranged relations between states and markets. In this course, we examine this perspective but also build on it to consider neoliberalism as a cultural and ideological phenomenon that affects the perception of problems and conception of solutions. We learn and apply sociological theories of state-market relationships to explore the changing role of economic markets. From this foundation, we will draw on insights from diverse perspectives (including history, cultural sociology, economic sociology, and critical geography) to address topics such as:<br/>How ideas about individualism and progress influence the material world and peoples’ lived<br/>experiences; How neoliberalism altered approaches to international development and poverty; and  how neoliberal ideas and practices have altered who and what we consider to be the subjects and objects of policy.</p>';

How do the power dynamics of early modern Japanese homoeroticism challenge our ideas of male homosexuality? Why have Japanese writers and other cultural producers so brilliantly envisioned certain relationships and forms of intimacy over time?  Taught in English for students with no background in Japanese culture, this course is an overview of stories of unrequited affection, passion, erotic desire, jealousy, and other tropes of “love and desire.” As a main premise of the intersectional conception of the course, we will examine how Japanese poetry, fiction, theater, and film about “love” intersect with longings for tradition, the nation, and/or hierarchies of race and class. General questions addressed during the course include the following: How is desire constructed in different narrative forms and historical/cultural contexts? What language do we use to describe sexualities and gender roles from a different time and place? How can we challenge U.S.-based, contemporary concepts of gender roles and sexual identities? What do we possibly take for granted with our assumptions concerning the most intimate ways in which we relate to others? What hierarchies of intimacies do we create? This class is relevant for students interested in Japanese culture and history. Students with a general interest in gender and sexuality are very welcome. Please note that there will occasionally be graphic imagery involving sex and violence appearing in texts. The structure of the class usually works as follows: A short introductory lecture, then an hour of discussion. There will be a mandatory film screening on Wednesday evenings (7-9 pm, about 1-2 hours) for about ½ of the weeks. Contact instructor for syllabus.<br/></p>';

Even your dictionary can’t decide if a novella is a “long short story” or a “short novel.” The novella might be the most uncertain of fictional forms, but it is also one of the most agile. It can span the length of an afternoon in one hundred and forty pages or tackle an entire lifetime in a scant sixty. It requires the restraint of a short story and the density and substance of a novel. Over the course of this semester, we will read a selection of novellas, both classic and contemporary, in an attempt to arrive at our own definitions of the form. More importantly, perhaps, you will also be writing your own novella and putting it up for workshop as it progresses. This senior capstone class is for creative writers ready for an ambitious project, an extended prose piece that defies easy categorization. Through discussion, peer review, and lectures about the craft of writing longer work, you will wrestle with this form in an attempt at understanding, maybe even mastery.</p>';

The course will start with first asking, Is President Barack Obama a Black leader or a leader who happens to be Black? And why does that matter to the Black community and its racial equity agenda? The exploration of this contemporary debate aims to illuminate the contentious political terrain that Obama enters as he walks on the heels of countless Black leaders before him. We will then dive immediately into questioning what then is Black politics? And what is the crisis of Black leadership then and now?

In 1839, Daguerre’s invention was presented as “a free gift to the world.”  This course will look at how that gift has been put to use in photographic cultures around the world in contexts as diverse as portrait studios in Yogyakarta, a history museum in Vietnam, French advertising, Soviet family albums and news imagery circulating worldwide. While we will pay careful attention to visual aesthetics, we will focus on photography as a documentary genre that has long been central to how individuals imagine the world beyond their experience.

How do the power dynamics of early modern Japanese homoeroticism challenge our ideas of male homosexuality? Why have Japanese writers and other cultural producers so brilliantly envisioned certain relationships and forms of intimacy over time?  Taught in English for students with no background in Japanese culture, this course is an overview of stories of unrequited affection, passion, erotic desire, jealousy, and other tropes of “love and desire.” As a main premise of the intersectional conception of the course, we will examine how Japanese poetry, fiction, theater, and film about “love” intersect with longings for tradition, the nation, and/or hierarchies of race and class. General questions addressed during the course include the following: How is desire constructed in different narrative forms and historical/cultural contexts? What language do we use to describe sexualities and gender roles from a different time and place? How can we challenge U.S.-based, contemporary concepts of gender roles and sexual identities? What do we possibly take for granted with our assumptions concerning the most intimate ways in which we relate to others? What hierarchies of intimacies do we create?

But what happens when we add gender to this mix? What are the different roles that women take on in social movements and how can we account for differences across movements? How do gender, race, and class intersect in social movements? For example, what happens when we compare the ideas of progress in Black Lives Matter and white nationalist movements with particular emphasis on women’s place(s) in the future? In this course, we scrutinize the intersections of race, class, and gender as they relate to the ideals to which movements aspire. Social movements that emphasize concepts such as progress, development, and nation-making indicate visions of the future that can illuminate how gender, race, and class shape peoples’ lives. We will focus on the experiences of women (as individuals and as members of groups or organizations) in their historical and structural locations and explore what concepts such as progress, development, and nation-making mean for women in the struggle over feminist meanings and claims.</p>';
