descCRN['crs30824'] = 'Notes:<br/>Popular culture is often perceived as only a means of entertainment. In this course, however, we treat popular culture as central to the production and reproduction of identity categories to examine how images, ideologies and behaviors are created and represented in American popular culture. Most importantly, the course will explore the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and class in popular culture representations of identity to broadly discuss how identity markers are produced, how they change over time, and how they interlock to form larger structural inequalities and systems of oppression. We will focus on representations of Latinx bodies in the media, blackness and criminality, feminist politics and post-feminist culture, and representations of race and gender in animated films. In addition, students will question their own taken-for-granted notions about what popular culture is and what it does to gendered and raced relations to situate popular culture as a contested space of subjugation and disempowerment as well as one of resistance and possibility.';

descCRN['crs30368'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with HIST 277-01*<br/>Japan\'s rapid industrialization in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and its phenomenal rise as the number two economic power in the world after the devastation wrought by World War II, have led many scholars to declare Japan a model worthy of emulation by all "developing" nations. After an examination of feudal Japan, this course probes the nature and course of Japan\'s "amazing transformation" and analyzes the consequences of its strengths as a nation-state. Considerable study of Japanese art, literature, and religion will be undertaken and American attitudes toward the Japanese and their history will also be examined. (4 credits)';
descCRN['crs30835'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with ART 270-01*<br/>What defines Sacred Art or makes a Sacred Space? What roles do material practices play in fostering a religious experience? This course contemplates answers to these questions by focusing on religious visual culture in Asia and examining how intangible concepts of the divine have become tangible in art and architecture. To better understand the multilayered functioning of devotional objects and spaces associated with religious doctrines such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shintoism, the class will explore foundations in iconography and then compare different religious objects and spaces through concepts such as gender, state power, the body, nature, the grotesque, and death. The meaning of such imagery is not static, however. Therefore, we will also reflect on how the significance of religious objects change in the space of a museum. Ultimately, this course allows us to contemplate the multifaceted ways religious beliefs have been visualized and how these manifestations exemplify systems of cultural exchange in Asia.';
descCRN['crs30020'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with AMST 315-01 and HIST 315-01; no first year students allowed*<br/>In this discussion-based seminar, we will examine U.S. Global presence through the lenses of empire, diaspora, and transnationalism. We will look specifically at U.S. involvement in the Philippines and Viet Nam from 1898 to 1975 as moments of military occupation and cultural domination, as well as turning points for U.S. nation-building. What is "imperialism" and how is it different from "hegemony"? How did U.S. imperial adventures in Asia help to recreate a Western geographic imaginary of the "East"? How did they reshape or reconfigure "American" positions and identities? Under what circumstances were former imperial subjects allowed to generate racialized communities? To what extent are memories of U.S. conflicts in Asia cultivated, proliferated, twisted, or suppressed? What lessons can be garnered for the contemporary historical moment? Other topics for exploration include: internment, transracial adoption, commemorations of war, and anti-imperialist/anti-war movements. Cross-listed with American Studies 315 and History 315.

descCRN['crs30695'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with GEOG 320-01; first day attendance required*<br/>Since the last century, Asia has experienced rapid urbanization. It is now home to over half of the world’s most populated cities. By 2010, the urban population in the Asia-Pacific region has surpassed the population of the United States and the European Union combined. In this course, we will focus on cities in East, Southeast and South Asia. We will first contextualize the rapid urbanization in the region’s changing political economy, and identify urban issues that are unique to this region. We will further explore different theoretical approaches to understand Asian cities; several of them challenge mainstream urban theories rooted in the experiences of West European and North American cities. Upon the completion of this course, students will acquire substantive knowledge on contemporary trends of urban development in Asia, and develop familiarity with related ongoing theoretical debates. In addition, students will conduct individual research projects to develop deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes in Asia.';

descCRN['crs30170'] = 'Notes:<br/>It’s entirely possible for one to analyze the meanings of most texts—their themes, morals, historical significances, and so on—without paying much attention to the formal and linguistic elements that produce such meanings. Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously figures the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up such questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, and the very question of what poetry is.

In ENGL 136, we will read plays--both classic and modern--as literary texts and talk about the craft that went into their writing. But we will also take field trips to see several plays at different theaters in Minneapolis and St. Paul; we will study theater reviews and write some of our own; we will meet people who work on technical aspects of productions (like lighting and costumes) and learn about the craft of building productions; and we will think, talk, and write about the relationship between the dramatic arts and current events. As part of our larger goal of putting theater in context, the "current" events we study will cover topics as diverse as science vs religion, processes of nation building, personal identities put on trial, class politics and accents, and historical notions of property, and the work we read will range from Shakespeare to the present.';

For example, can the beautiful be political? What happens to nature\'s beauty in an era of environmental crisis? And how are shifting gender norms redefining beauty in today\'s world? The novels we will study critique and analyze these issues even as they revel in the complexity of beauty across time, space, artistic forms, media, and cultures.

This course offers you the opportunity to do so. Beginning with Ferdinand de Saussure’s influential Course in General Linguistics, we’ll trace the development of literary theory through structuralism, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, feminism, gender studies, queer theory, Black studies, postcolonial theory, trauma theory, affect theory, and ecocriticism. Since our approach will be to treat literary theory as a field of study in itself, we’ll be reading almost exclusively primary texts from this field—though, if you engage these texts seriously, they will most likely change the way you read just about everything, from poems and novels to television shows and text messages. This course will be of interest to students of all levels who are interested in learning about literary theory and are willing to be intellectually challenged.

descCRN['crs30173'] = 'Notes:<br/>In the past fifty years, science fiction has emerged as the primary cultural form for thinking about human extinction: climate catastrophe and natural disasters, plagues that empty continents, and species suicide through war. But science fiction has also emerged as the primary cultural form for imagining a near boundless future through technological progress: artificial superintelligence, cybernetic enhancement of the human, and the possibility of utopian political order. Facing such disorienting and unfathomable changes, science fiction seeks with frantic energy to understand what it means to be a human and to live a meaningful life. Why are we here? What are we to become? How will the promises of technology, or the lethal threats of scarcity, change what it means to be a thinking, feeling human? In this course we will examine works of science fiction as complex aesthetic achievements, as philosophical inquiries into the nature of being and time, and as theoretical examinations of the nature of human cognition. We will engage in intensive readings of contemporary texts, including works by Ted Chiang, Lidia Yuknavitch, Philip K.

descCRN['crs30174'] = 'Notes:<br/>As the United states lurched toward murderous civil war, a group of passionate, visionary, and bizarre artists set out to discover the soul of America. From 1850 to 1855, in one of the most astonishing creative convergences in literary history, the artists of what would come to be known as the American Renaissance wrote stories and poems that would enlighten, thrill, and terrify generations of readers. With aesthetic wonder and philosophical insight, they revealed both the angels and demons of human nature, inventing a uniquely American spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they damned it all to hell. Their works were spiritual and blasphemous, elegant and profane, beatific and pornographic, irreverently comic and heartwrenchingly sentimental. Everything that was written in America after this period would, in one way or another, have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this small cluster of artists. In this course we will read texts by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. (4 credits)';

descCRN['crs30180'] = 'Notes:<br/>A historically small area of Ireland—called the Pale—was held under British rule in the late-medieval period. To be “beyond the pale” is to cross over some invisible, often arbitrary, boundary, to be inconveniently and antisocially out of line. Many postcolonial Irish and Caribbean writers have been forced to exist beyond the pale politically and in terms of their access (or lack of it) to the literary establishment. This idiomatic connection to Ireland has a more concrete resonance in Jamaica, where the Irish are the second largest ethnic group after people of African descent, and many of Jamaica’s placenames derive from Irish locations. Taking up these fascinating links, this course will explore the significance of Irish-Caribbean literary and cultural connections in art, dance (live Irish musicians and a céilí dance instructor will visit our class!), poetry, theatre, and fiction. We will ask what it means to be from a small island in a globalizing world by reading authors such as Claude McKay, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Marlon James, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Lorna Goodison, Frank McCourt, Eavan Boland, Grace Nichols, Nicole Dennis-Benn, and Sara Baume.';

In the last few decades, the young adult genre has been growing in scope and in ambition, and much of it is being written by exciting new authors, closer to the age of their protagonists. In this class we will study some new and foundational texts of the genre, discussing subjects like depiction of mental illness, the political implications of fantasy novels, and the “We Need Diverse Books” campaign. Meanwhile, you will be working on your own YA projects, learning for yourself what makes these books tick.';

descCRN['crs30176'] = 'Notes:<br/>In Shakespeare’s England, whipping, branding, mutilation (of the hand, nose, ears, or face), pillorying, hanging, burning, and beheading were common forms of legal punishment. The rigors of early modern law may seem strange or “barbaric” to us, yet we may recognize the intentions behind the laws: to restore order, to keep the peace, and to stabilize social relations. To grasp what justice meant to the early moderns and, in turn, what it means to us today, we will examine some of Shakespeare’s most challenging plays through the lens of legal and political philosophy. Plays such as Titus Andronicus, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, King Lear, and Othello stage a spectrum of responses to insult, injury, and violence. At the same time, the texts trouble the division between good and evil, justice and revenge. Our agenda is two-fold: to deepen our reading of Shakespearean drama and to use our knowledge to investigate difficult and still unresolved questions about the problem of evil, the dialectic between law and justice, and the meaning of the “good life.”';

This was only one of the many metamorphoses Nabokov underwent while in exile, moving from Russia to the Crimea, Cambridge UK, Berlin, Paris, Cambridge MA, Ithaca, Hollywood, and finally Montreux. Members of the Russian nobility, the Nabokovs lost everything with the 1917 Revolution except for their immense cultural capital, which Nabokov transformed into a tremendously productive career as a writer, critic, translator and scholar in Russian, French, and English. This course examines both the Russian (in translation) and English novels.

descCRN['crs30171'] = 'Notes:<br/>Jane Austen is still very much with us today. The mid-1990s saw an explosion of cinematic and televised adaptions of her novels. A flurry of Austenian mash-ups followed, merging zombies, vampires, and sea monsters with the trappings of the Regency era. Austen erotica, meanwhile, has not only emerged but boomed in recent years: in addition to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, we now have works such as Pride and Promiscuity and Spank Me, Mr. Darcy. Just what makes Austen so lastingly compelling and yet so open to diverse modes of adaptation and appropriation? This course approaches this question through an in-depth study of her novels and of some of their prominent film adaptations. We’ll attend to Austen’s particular narrative and rhetorical techniques (such as free-indirect discourse and irony), consider how these techniques do or do not lend themselves to adaptation, and explore how the formal innovations of cinema foreground other, less noted elements of her writing. We’ll also pay particular attention to how Austen registers the social and political issues of her time (e.g. gender inequities, the marriage imperative, the abolition of the slave trade, the Napoleonic wars), and query why most adaptations tend to simplify or simply occlude such issues. Finally, we’ll be interested in examining what Austen’s novels have to say about our own political present, particularly with regard to issues of race, gender, and class. Readings include Austen’s major novels, a number of their adaptations, and works of theory and criticism by Mary Favret, Frances Ferguson, William Galperin, Claudia Johnson, Deirdre Lynch, D. A. Miller, Mary Poovey, Edward Said, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Ian Watt, and others. No prior knowledge of Austen or of film studies is required.';

But they all have their roots in the nineteenth century, when they gained strength in part through their intersections with rhetorics of race. This course will interrogate notions of race as they were being invented—exploring how they were popularized and used to dominate, how they failed, and how they were resisted in 19th-century Britain. We will read canonical and non-canonical texts, including works by writers of color, visual images, scientific theories, fiction, and non-fiction. Considering locations throughout the British empire, we will explore intersections of race with the history of British slavery, colonial settlement, gender politics, enfranchisement, war, and religion. Working together with students at Michigan State University and the University of Detroit-Mercy who are taking the co-developed parallel course, students will produce a digital final project: a full scholarly edition—including appendices, annotations, and a scholarly introduction—of a nineteenth-century memoir written by a person of color.';

The course consists of three interlocking objectives. The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project.

From the 2000s on, new African migratory species have been emerging from the storied depths of international seawaters – the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Easy, hand-me-down categories have been spun around, to catch them in the nets of expert discourses about “the immigrant experience,” “the immigration crisis” or in a never-ending gauntlet of xenophobic narratives about the “plague” of illegal immigration. This course focuses primarily on firsthand accounts, in Sub-Saharan francophone film, literature, and popular culture, of the dark underside of transnational mobility. How do these marginalized voices resonate with contemporary francophone novels, essays, and films that attempt to convey and document their experiences? How do these transnational and transdiasporic wretched of the sea, abjected from the “sacred” spaces of citizenship at home and community abroad, force all postcolonial subjects, across the board, to attend to the structures of economic, political and cultural agency that underlie the radical emergence of previously "invisible" subalterns from the depths of an "other" Black Atlantic?

One of the oldest forms of human communications, they ultimately express the many ways we attempt to understand the world and be part of it. The explorers, their itineraries, and their diaries offer a complex view of this world, too. This course will expose the different interactions between maps, explorers, and writers from Antiquity to present. During the Renaissance and later explorations, colonization also ushered a significant challenge to Christian and Muslim accounts of their travels. The indigenous peoples of Africa and the Americas offered ways for the explorers and cartographers to express their consternation or their enthusiasm and to subvert what was ordered by kings or queens. Our class will explore the ways that Egyptians and Greeks (Aristotle, Plato, Ptolémée) influenced the thought of travelers of the Middle Ages (Marco Polo). We will discuss French Renaissance exploration and travel writing (Verrazano, Cartier, Thevet, Léry, Lescarbot, Christine de Pizan, Montaigne) and artists/cartographers (Leonard de Vinci, Michel Angelo Dürer, Alberti). We will read about the influences of 17th and 18th century mapmakers (Champlain, Finé, Roccoco and Baroque art/maps) through diaries of Hennepin, Nicollet, Champlain, la Carte du tendre. The 19th century will bring many diaries and maps from utopian discourse (Villemart, Gustave Raulin, Charles-Albert Gauthier) to romantic travels (Victor Hugo, Jules Vernes). The study of contemporary diaries (Ruffin, Le Clezio, Amélie Nothomb and Sophie Calle) and their maps of the world will be studied through discussion and will show the changing dynamics of identity and the other in the Modern world. Taught in French. Offered occasionally. (4 credits) These concepts and ideas will be debated through the study of journals, maps, and philosophical and literary texts of the time. Students will visit the Ford Library, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center for studies of maps, their philosophical concepts (Aristotle, Plato, Erasmus, Machievelli, Descartes, Kant, Foucault, Didi-Huberman, Jean Luc Nancy, Greenblatt, Onfray) and their conceptualizations from late Sixteenth century to present.';

Political geography offers concepts and approaches to help us think through the complex intersections of people, place, and politics that constitute the struggle to create and maintain nation-states. Thus the first part of the course is devoted to enhancing your understanding of core concepts, such as nation, state, territory, sovereignty, scale, borders, and geographical imagination. The ultimate purpose of this first part of the course then is to assemble a framework for understanding why our contemporary organization of territory throughout the world looks the way it does. Equipped with these foundations, we explore topics in the second part of class that help you think critically about the stability of nations and the organization of territory into the nation-state system as well as challenges to these institutions. Toward this end, you will also conduct an independent research project on a single group\'s attempt to create a nation-state.

Many museums see themselves as the authorities on the proper storage, maintenance, and care of sacred items or cultural objects, while American Indian nations argue that the impositions of museum collectors and curators fail to acknowledge indigenous traditions and belief systems. We will investigate how American Indians work to regain control of sacred objects and, in turn, regain control of their history and the historical narrative through the repatriation of stolen items and objects, the implementation of decolonization practices in museums, and the growth of tribal museums. This course combines scholarly research and readings with field trips to exhibits at several local museums, including “Renewing What They Gave Us: Native American Artists in Residence” at the Minnesota History Center, the “Native American Exhibition” at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and a curator-led exploration at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Enrollment is limited in order to facilitate these trips.';

Students will consider present resource exploitation in connection to the more recent historical eras of: the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, “legitimate commerce,” colonialism and neo-colonialism. They will also learn about the role of Africa’s resources as essential to western prosperity. This course will address the ethical, social, and environmental implications of the system of extraction and the resulting violence that is inevitably one of the most common and most severe consequences of it. While all resources will be briefly considered and minerals such as, coltan (columbite-tantalite) and cobalt and platinum in areas such as west-central Africa (the Congos, Zambia) and southern Africa will be addressed, special attention will go to diamonds and oil and the particular mining and drilling industries in those areas. This course will intertwine historical sources, films and literature about the history of resource extraction in Africa with current journal and newspaper articles that document these continuing realities. Readings will come from journal articles, primary sources and the following texts: The New Scramble for Africa, Padraig Carmody; Warfare in Independent Africa, Will Reno, 2011; The New Kings of Crude: China, India and the Global Struggle for Oil, Luke Patey, 2014; Stones of Contention, Todd Cleveland, 2014; Being Nuclear: Africans and the Global Uranium Trade, Gabrielle Hecht 2012; Colonial Extractions: Race and Canadian Mining in Contemporary Africa, Paula Butler, 2015.';

What is "imperialism" and how is it different from "hegemony"? How did U.S. imperial adventures in Asia help to recreate a Western geographic imaginary of the "East"? How did they reshape or reconfigure "American" positions and identities? Under what circumstances were former imperial subjects allowed to generate racialized communities? To what extent are memories of U.S. conflicts in Asia cultivated, proliferated, twisted, or suppressed? What lessons can be garnered for the contemporary historical moment?

One of the most significant trends of the current era has been globalization: the shrinking of distances, the greater interpenetration of the world\'s peoples, and the rise, perhaps, of a so-called global culture. Yet it is too simple to say, "it\'s all a big mix," for the questions of how the mixing is done, and who mixes, are complex. The study of literature illuminates these questions. By reading important recent texts, this course tackles "world" questions: what does it mean to be from a certain place? what is a culture? and who are we in it?

While we will pay careful attention to visual aesthetics, we will focus on photography as a documentary genre that has long been central to how individuals imagine the world beyond their experience. We will also be considering personal photographic archives such as family albums and scrapbooks and asking when private photographs become public representations. One central feature of the course will be learning about how scholars have thought about and through photography and discussing the complications of applying these theories transhistorically and cross-culturally. (Berger, Barthes, Benjamin, Sontag, Sekula, Strassler, Pinney, Tagg, Azoulay) Topics for discussion include debates around truth in photography and the politics of representation, photography’s relationship to history and changing institutional uses of photography, as well as different photographic cultures and their anthropological and sociological significance.

In this course you will be trained to produce and recognize (almost) all the sounds which human languages make use of, and to develop a systematic way of analyzing and recording them. Since sounds are perceived as well as produced, you will also be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech, learning how acoustic signals of frequency, amplitude, and duration are translated into visible, quantifiable images. You will learn the art of decoding these spectrograms into sounds and words and sentences. The linguistics laboratory contains several different programs for practicing and listening to sounds from many of the world\'s languages. This course is recommended for students of foreign languages, drama, music and anyone who wants to become more aware of their (and other people\'s) pronunciation. (4 credits)';
descCRN['crs30424'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with SOCI 175-01*<br/>Sociolinguistics is the study of the social language variation inevitable in all societies, be they closed and uniform or diverse and multicultural. Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture. As humans, we judge each other constantly on the basis of the way we talk, we make sweeping generalizations about people\'s values and moral worth solely on the basis of the language they speak. Diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. If someone criticizes our language we feel they are criticizing our inmost self. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who speak differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity. (4 credits)';

Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we\'ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we\'ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we\'ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we\'ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them.

descCRN['crs30505'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Prerequisite MUSI 114 OR permission of instructor*<br/>This course provides a survey of Western art music from the early works of Ludwig van Beethoven, composed in the mid-1790s, to the symphonic works of the generation of modernist composers born around 1860 (Gustav Mahler, Jean Sibelius, Giacomo Puccini, Richard Strauss). One principal aim of the course is to expose students to a large quantity of multi-national Western music in a variety of genres and styles, thus leading students to a deeper understanding of the development of musical style in the nineteenth century. In addition to the musical works themselves, and no less importantly, the course stresses the contexts surrounding the musical texts. Lectures address the political, cultural, and intellectual history that directed the path of musical style in this period. Students are therefore expected to become familiar not only with specific works and the stylistic footprints of many composers, but also with the significant cultural-historical events and trends that informed composition during this period--the pan-European revolutions of 1848, the aesthetic ideology of autonomous music, the public music culture of the European bourgeoisie, the relationship between musical reception and various strains of European nationalism, and so on. Classroom activities include lectures, directed listening of pieces on the listening list (and sometimes, for comparison, other works), some formal and stylistic analysis, and discussion.

The genre includes some of the most ambitious, innovative, and seminal vocal works of the past five hundred years. We will begin the term by looking at the Passion form’s growth into the paradigmatic settings of Johann Sebastian Bach. Our study will then consider several modern expansions upon this legacy. We will examine the evolving narrative/dramatic sense of these works, their roles in liturgical and/or concert performance, the inclusion of non-canonical (and non-Christological) texts, their myriad sociopolitical implications, and of course, the novelties of their musical language.

Why did the war break out, and what does this tell us about the causes of war more generally? 2. Who was to blame for the war, and what does this tell us about the morality of war? 3. What was the character of the war? How was it fought? How did it end? And what does this tell us about the relationship between economics, culture, technology and war? 4. How did the war transform the societies that fought it? And what does this tell us about the relationship between war and political development? 5. How did the war transform the international system? How did the First World War set the stage not only for the Second World War, but also subsequent conflicts in the Middle East (the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Gulf War, etc.) and Europe (the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo)? And what does this tell us about the impact of war on global political life? This course will address these questions through a reading of both primary and secondary sources. Particular attention will be paid to the politics of the way in which the war has been portrayed, explained and justified in the historiographical literature.';

How and why do women’s experiences of displacement differ, generally, from the experiences of men? And how can gender-sensitive approaches transform humanitarian action? How do structural inequalities around gender and race factor into the current global economic order? In this intermediate-level course, we will explore these questions and others as we examine the roles of women and gender in contemporary world politics. We will also explore some of the key contributions of feminist scholarship and activism in areas such as international peace and security, humanitarian action, economic development, and international criminal justice.';
descCRN['crs30587'] = 'Notes:<br/>This course is intended to introduce students to the relatively new subfield of “Religion and International Relations”. It is divided into three sections. The first addresses the issue of the strange absence of religion from the field of International Relations (and, indeed, from the social sciences more broadly) and the consequences of this absence for our understanding of global politics. The second explores the various ways in which IR scholars have attempted to redress the absence by bringing religion into the study of International Relations Theory. The third and final section provides an overview of the ways in which IR scholars have explored the intersection of religion and global political life, especially in the areas of conflict, development, global governance, and law. As an intermediate-level offering, this course is designed primarily for Political Science majors and non-majors in related fields (such as Religious Studies). The course has no pre-requisites, however, and is therefore suitable for all students seeking to satisfy an interest in the relationship between religion and international politics.';
descCRN['crs30588'] = 'Notes:<br/>Civil war is the most widespread and deadly manifestation of political violence in our time. Civil wars vary dramatically: some are fought with mechanized weapons on conventional battleﬁelds, while others are fought by guerrilla insurgencies that blend into the countryside; some are waged by groups motivated by utopian political and religious ideologies, while others are waged over plunder or ethnic resentments; sometimes rebels win and impose revolutionary governments, while sometimes regimes rely on genocidal violence to stay in power. In this course we will try to answer questions such as: Why do civil wars cluster in certain countries, in certain regions, and at certain times? Are individuals motivated to form and join rebel organizations due to greed, grievances, opportunities, or their social environments? Why do some rebels resort to terrorism against civilians (Ireland’s IRA) while others build schools and hospitals (Sri Lanka’s LTTE—which also employed terrorism)? Why do states intervene in distant civil wars, and how do they promote their interests or attempt to build peace? When do rebels lay down their arms to enter democratic politics (El Salvador’s FMLN), when do they transition to violent crime (Colombia’s BACRIMes), and what does this mean for the survival of peace? There are two vitally important reasons for studying civil war: ﬁrst, because making sense of conﬂict processes (instead of simply dismissing them as senseless) helps us develop tools to prevent, mitigate, and end civil war violence; and second, because in studying civil war we gain an understanding of—and empathy for—human nature in extreme circumstances.';

Funding for humanitarianism has skyrocketed; humanitarian organizations have expanded their public support, as well as their activities; and, increasingly, humanitarian issues have found a place at the center of policy decisions. It is also generally agreed that humanitarianism is in crisis owing to the growing awareness of the sometimes harmful effects of aid; the expansion of the concept of humanitarianism to include human rights, development, and peace-building; and the increasing involvement of states in humanitarian operations.

Despite his promises, President Trump\'s ability to make unilateral policy changes is constrained not only by Congress and the Courts, but by the federal bureaucracy (the 4th branch). This course examines the role that members of the federal bureaucracy play in setting policy agendas, writing rules and regulations that have the force of law, implementing laws on the books, enforcing compliance with existing laws, and expanding opportunities for Americans to participate in governance.

descCRN['crs30689'] = 'Notes:<br/>This course introduces students to Russian folk belief, folk tales and ancient and pre-Soviet Russian culture. The corpus of fairy tales collected by Aleksandr Afanas’ev will serve as our base material. Like the Brothers Grimm, Afanas’ev collected a rich corpus of orally transmitted Russian skazki, a variety of tales that include animal tales, wonder tales, taboo tales, anecdotes, and tales of everyday life. This corpus of material will be supplemented by additional folklore and folk tales, including bylini (Russian epic tales) and literary skazki by Pushkin and Gogol. In studying these tales, their content and methods of transmission, we will touch upon the history of Russia and Russian culture, in particular, upon peasant culture and dvoeverie, a mix of pagan and Orthodox belief. The material will be approached from various critical perspectives, including Proppian morphology and psychoanalysis, in order to examine their mythic, archetypal, supernatural and taboo elements. All readings are in English. Final projects for the course include a research paper and a performance of selected tales led by and created by the class.';
descCRN['crs30838'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with ENGL 366-01*<br/>The scandal surrounding Vladimir Nabokov\'s 1955 novel about the nymphet Lolita finally made him a hugely successful celebrity, allowing him to retire from teaching at Cornell University and move to Switzerland to devote himself to fiction, translation, criticism and lepidoptery. This was only one of the many metamorphoses Nabokov underwent while in exile, moving from Russia to the Crimea, Cambridge UK, Berlin, Paris, Cambridge MA, Ithaca, Hollywood, and finally Montreux. Members of the Russian nobility, the Nabokovs lost everything with the 1917 Revolution except for their immense cultural capital, which Nabokov transformed into a tremendously productive career as a writer, critic, translator and scholar in Russian, French, and English. This course examines both the Russian (in translation) and English novels. A merciful defier of national, linguistic, cultural and theoretical categories, Nabokov remains paradoxically elusive and monumental, a thrilling and exasperating genius. (4 credits) Course cross-listed with English 366.';
descCRN['crs30640'] = 'Notes:<br/>Dostoevsky lived an extraordinary life. After achieving instant fame with the publication of Poor Folk, he languished in near obscurity for many years. He was sentenced to death for participation in a political society and was reprieved by the tsar just minutes before his scheduled execution. He served four years of hard labor in prison and another five years in exile in Siberia. He suffered from debilitating epilepsy and a compulsive gambling habit, and he struggled with massive debt. Yet by the end of his life the Russian public hailed him as a prophet and Russia’s greatest living writer. Like his life, his novels are extraordinary. They plumb the dark depths of the human soul, confronting the reader with issues of life and death, good and evil, and the presence of evil in God’s universe. In this course we will read Dostoevsky\'s four great novels Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov, as well as the misunderstood anti-nihilist work Notes from Underground.';

descCRN['crs30642'] = 'Notes:<br/>The course introduces students to the sociological imagination, or "the quality of mind essential to grasp the interplay of individual and society, of biography and history, of self and the world,” as C. Wright Mills dscribed it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples\' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology). Topics covered vary from semester to semester, but may include: socialization, suburbanization and housing, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class stratification, deviance and crime, economic and global inequality, families and intimate relationships, education, religion, and globalization. (4 credits)';
descCRN['crs30644'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with LING 175-01*<br/>Sociolinguistics is the study of the linguistic diversity. Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture, and diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who speak differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity. (4 credits.)';
descCRN['crs30643'] = 'Notes:<br/>When sociologists look at culture they look at things like people\'s leisure activities, consumption patterns, style, membership in subcultural groups, and the arts. A common thread throughout most of these studies of culture is how social class and culture intersect. For example, how do people\'s class backgrounds influence their forms of cultural expression in terms of their leisure activities, their beliefs, their personal style, or whom they want to hang out with? This course will explore these issues, focusing on class as a common theme. Specific topics include: the role of artists and people\'s development of aesthetic taste in the arts; social forces that push us towards conformity or towards individualism; subcultural groups; and how people make distinctions between themselves and those who they describe as "other."

descCRN['crs30645'] = 'Notes:<br/>For good or for ill, sports are inescapable parts of contemporary life. This course provides an overview of the social transformation of sports, from ancient into modern form. We begin with developing a theoretical vocabulary for describing and understanding the social dimensions of sports. What are sports? Why do sports fascinate people? How do sports create social bonding and social integration? The second major object of the course is to account for how sports become civilized during the transition from agrarian to urban, industrial societies. This civilizing process brought a dramatic reduction in socially tolerable levels of violence in sporting contests. It also begat the rationalization of sports: the growth of standardized rules for sports matches and the rise of new cultural rationales for legitimating mass participation in sports. Not only does sports becomes perceived as integral to adjusting to the demands to modern life, but as a remedy to the ills of modern living. The closing moments of the course brings us to the second major reconstruction of sports after WWII. The implication of sports in the rise of media empires, and consequently, the struggle for civil rights, also begets far-reaching reappraisals of the value of sports in a post-industrial society. Both profits and protests reinvigorate the search for the redeeming social value of sports amidst pervasive ambivalence about the big-league era.';
descCRN['crs30646'] = 'Notes:<br/>*Cross-listed with RELI 194-01*<br/>Globally and throughout the United States, right-wing authoritarianism and populism is on the rise. Parliamentary governments in Europe have seen previously-unthinkable victories by far right parties, and fascism within the United States has received a new boost of energy from the mainstreaming "Alt-Right" movement, which organizes on college campuses and in paramilitary formations, including multiple murders and deaths. We will examine fascist movements using contemporary political questions and concerns as our primary organizing lens. We will investigate the role of religion, authority, the creation of moral frameworks, and the strategies and tactics used by fascists, their opponents, and mainstream media discourses about both. Some of the key questions of the course will include: What is fascism and how is it similar to, and distinct from, other far right movements? Were pre-twentieth century movements like the KKK fascist? This class will move from historical beginnings to a series of debates and questions regarding contemporary fascist and antifascist movements, including questions of free speech, violence, the appropriation of liberal discourse, and the role of campuses in fascist strategy.';
descCRN['crs30647'] = 'Notes:<br/>What is social about sexuality? Sexuality and its components (desire, pleasure, love, the body) is something more than a personal or individual characteristic. It is socially constructed. Sexuality has been configured during different historical time periods as sin, as a means of fostering alliances between powerful families, as perversion, as a means to pleasure, as a symbol of love, and as personal identity. These different sexual configurations are connected with larger social-historical trends such as the development of capitalism, the use of rationalized technologies, and the expansion of scientific-medical discourse. In this course, we explore how sexuality has been constructed through history. We examine how categories shape our understanding of sexuality such as male/female, heterosexual/homosexual/queer. We also will address issues such as child sexuality, prostitution, images of sexual minorities in the media and heteronormativity. (4 credits)';

For both the research design and analysis sections, we will concentrate on quantitative research, learning how to use statistical software. (4 credits)';
descCRN['crs30650'] = 'Notes:<br/>This course is designed to engage students with the most sophisticated and useful schools of thought available in the social science disciplines. The course raises a number of questions: How can we best understand the complexities of self and society? Are these units of analysis useful in and of themselves? Are they contained in an essential body or polity that we can identify as some unitary entity called Jenny and John Doe, American, French, Arab/Jew, black/white, modern/primitive, developed/underdeveloped, Oriental/ Occidental, homo/heterosexual, male/female? Or are they socially produced units that have no essence in-of-themselves, produced and made real only through performance with the "Other"? Furthermore, is there something unique about modernity that has fundamentally transformed the notions of our selves, bodies, polities, races, and civilizations? If the answer to the last question is in the affirmative, how and why did this come to be the case, and what consequences does it hold for our understanding of the past and of the future? These are the kinds of questions that great figures in sociology have been asking since the nineteenth-century, including classic theorists like Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx, as well as more recent writers such as Ervin Goffman, Michel Foucault, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Edward Said.';

These less represented understandings of trauma are not only highly varied and differently impactful, but challenge in turn dominant constructions and narratives of trauma and what is considered to be “traumatic.” Exploring trauma through a critical intersectional feminist lens gives us the ability to connect the ways “individual” pain, one’s own lived experience, is tied to the social—to interlocking systems of oppression, which (overly)determine bodies and life chances. While much of our focus touches on trauma’s bodily effects, the ways in which trauma accumulates and resides in/on the flesh and psyche, we will also explore the ways these rupturing conditions produce modes of individual and collective resistance to dominant violence. Thus, stories of healing, renewal and resistance from marginalized communities and peoples will also figure centrally in this course.';

This course builds on that relationship by juxtaposing activist social work with theoretical writings on globalization, gender, race, class-relations, sexuality, community, democracy, and civil society, and exploring how these arenas inform and transform each other. The issues in this seminar are related ultimately to the student\'s "location," personally and professionally, at the threshold of the future, in search of a space of her/his own. One substantial research paper and a formal oral presentation on its ideas are the primary assignments. Preferred: a working relationship with a local women\'s or minority organization, established the spring or summer prior to enrollment in the course. (4 credits)';
