We will explore these issues and more in addition to learning about the practicalities of a range of museum departments and jobs (including collections management and care, curation, development, and education). The museum field is broad and inherently interdisciplinary, reflecting the liberal arts at work. Thus, this course will include a major Digital Liberal Arts  project: reconstructing Macalester’s now-defunct museum. We will work in Macalester’s archives to determine what it consisted of and what happened to the items from the museum when they were removed. We will visit the local museums to which some of the original museum material was transferred. We will then transition into reimagining a “Macalester Museum” with Omeka’s digital content management system. This hands-on exploration of Digital Liberal Arts and Digital Storytelling will draw upon a wide range of texts and experts to consider how our concepts have changed regarding what makes a museum.</p>';

descCRN[10028] = '<p>This course seeks to explain the evolving pattern of cities across the earth in terms of the distribution and movement of resources and people. In addition, a careful analysis of the development and internal spatial structure of North American cities will be carried out. Much class time will be spent on discussion of contemporary urban problems such as segregation, unequal investment, and control of public space as well as attempts at their solution. We make extensive use of the Twin Cities as a case study. Field work required. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10029] = '<p>*First Year Course only; first day attendance required* This course introduces you to urban geography, a discipline focused on understanding urbanization and its influence on society. We will also draw on perspectives from history, political science, and sociology to examine how the built environment of cities are shaped by human activity and how, in turn, urban life is shaped by the built environment. This course will have a special emphasis on exploring the history, geography, economics and politics of St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis. We will take advantage of our urban location by engaging the urban environment of the Twin Cities through local case studies, field study exercises, and visits to cultural institutions in the community. We will draw on our engagement with the local urban environment to demonstrate broad themes in the academic study of urban geography (e.g., the effect of transportation systems on urban development; city government, metropolitan fragmentation and regionalism; the search for community in urban settings; urban growth and neighborhood change; and, the effect of the global market economy on individual cities) at a more personal level. Directed field study exercises will help you learn analytical skills. Writing assignments will help you synthesize knowledge from exercises, lectures, and assigned readings. An independent project will help you hone your argumentative writing and ability to conduct college-level research. This course satisfies the college’s W (WA) – writing as argument – general education requirement.<br/>Other details: This course provides you with a great opportunity to leave campus and engage people and places in Minneapolis-St. Paul. This will require from you a willingness to explore the city by bus, bike, foot, and train. It will also require a solid work ethic to complete the field study exercises in a timely fashion. You will be rewarded with foundational knowledge of St. Paul and the greater Twin Cities region that you will draw upon throughout your career at Macalester. I am excited to have a residential first year course, and I look forward to working with a curious and dynamic group this fall.<br/></p>';

descCRN[10031] = '<p>*First Year Course only; first day attendance required* This class goes beyond the superficial media interpretations of the vast African continent to complicate our understanding of this fascinating region.  As geographers, we will place contemporary African developments in their historical and global context. The course provides a basic background in African history and physical geography, leading to discussion of advanced topics in contemporary African studies.  The course covers a broad range contemporary topics, including: human-environment interactions (forest and drylands management); population dynamics (population growth, distribution and mobility); medical geography (disease, health care and policy); agricultural development (traditional farming systems, cash crops, policy); urban economies (evolution of the urban structure, industry, housing); political geography (democratization, conflict); culture and change; development; and social geography. This course fulfills the argumentative writing (WA) requirement.</p>';
descCRN[10032] = '<p>This course challenges students to critically examine global population issues from a local-scale perspective and to understand the local context in which regional and international population patterns emerge. Using the lens of Geography, we will investigate the dynamic interplay between individual, local, regional, national, and international scales and the implications of scale, culture and perspective in dissecting current population issues. We will also use individual countries as case studies to examine population policies. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the data and methods used by population geographers to describe and analyze changes in human populations at sub-national scales, and will implement these skills in an independent research project. (4 credits).</p>';
descCRN[10033] = '<p>We now live in a world where the majority of the population already lives in cities. And yet every year, hundreds of millions of people continue to move into cities to pursue a better future. The contemporary social, economic, and political changes are intrinsically linked to divergent urban processes across the world. This paramount shift poses important theoretical and empirical questions to our age. This course uses the critical perspective of “global urbanism” to both contextualize and connect different urban experiences across places. We will introduce various urban settings and demonstrate how complex relations between urbanization, globalization, and economic development produce spatial unevenness and social inequality. We will study the dominant paradigm of world and global cities, which prioritizes development trajectories of cities in the global North, and discuss contesting views focusing on “ordinary cities” from the global South. Drawing on case studies in the developed and less-developed world, we will also learn how to apply the relational comparative urbanism approach as well as regionally-based theoretical perspectives to comprehend the diverse urban landscapes around the globe.</p>';
descCRN[10034] = '<p>This course discusses the foundations of American urban life and metropolitan development today, and examines how and why urban housing markets operate as they do within American metropolitan regions. Topics covered in the course include: the metropolitan economy, land use patterns, urban housing supply and demand, the geography of urban housing markets, suburbanization, transportation, and public policy debates. By the end of the course, students will have mastered some of the methods used to describe metropolitan organization and change, and be able to analyze how changes in the economy and society relate to metropolitan land use.

descCRN[10035] = '<p>*Cross-listed with ASIA 294-03; first day attendance required* Whether the twenty-first century will be dominated by the “rising Asia” has spurred recurring debates in policy and academic circles. But what is Asia? How can we understand this diverse region where more than half of the world’s population resides? In this course, we will first deconstruct the idea of Asia as a cartographic entity to excavate the layered social-cultural meaning and geographical diversity of the “Asias.” We will also place the “Asias” in a global context to reveal how contemporary Asia anchors the changing world political economy and cultural imaginations outside the West. We will begin with important theoretical debates on (East) Asian development that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s, including discussions about the colonial past, the path-dependency of development and uneven industrialization, regional disparities and mega-urbanization. We will then use these debates as the foundation to explore the contemporary globalizing Asia. What are the important connections between Asian countries, and with other parts of the world? What are the role of the “Asias” in international governance and geo-politics? Can China replace the United States as the dominant geo-economic power? These are the questions we will explore in this course.</p>';

descCRN[10038] = '<p>*First day attendance required* Social scientists use qualitative methods to understand the ways in which societal associations operate and how people experience, contribute to, or try to change these associations. Qualitative research methods are thus concerned with analyzing processes and experiences. This course trains students to use qualitative research methods to collect data, analyze it, draw authoritative conclusions, and observe professional research ethics. The course emphasizes how qualitative methods contribute to scientific research and how ethical treatment of research participants affects the practice of qualitative research. Above all, the course focuses on training students to conduct qualitative research that contributes to our understanding of human geographies. Students will develop these skills by engaging in a semester-long student-driven research project. Participation in this project will help you learn how to plan, prepare, and carry out a qualitative research project on a deadline. <br/><br/>In 2016, we will be working with the Union Park District Council in St. Paul, helping to launch and support a “cultural asset mapping” project. The Union Park district contains a number of the neighborhoods around Macalester and we will focus on a small isolate segment of the Midway neighborhood. The area is north of Interstate 94 and bounded by Prior, University, and Snelling avenues. The Union Park district council would like to know more about neighbor perceptions of the built environment especially as it relates to walkability and the potential for place-making. The District Council would like to support some improvements but wants resident input and ideas in order to work with community leaders and stakeholders. We will work in teams and as individuals to support this work through a combination of interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. We will also employ digital mapping technologies. Together, students will author a report for the Union Park District Council that documents the ways residents see their neighborhood, the cultural assets that are located therein, and the ways in which the built environment might be changed in order to support place-making efforts and improve the pedestrian experience.</p>';

descCRN[10043] = '<p>In 1870, the Linguistic Society of Paris decreed that all papers on the topic of the origin of speech were inadmissible. In recent years, speculations about the evolutions of language have become respectable once again, as attested by the number of international conferences on the topic, and journals devoted to it. Although we are only a little closer to a description of "proto-human" than we were back in 1870, it is now universally recognized that there are no primitive languages, and that neither the comparative method of historical linguistics nor internal reconstruction can allow us to reconstruct the earliest human languages (although they still allow us to make inferences about Proto-Indo-European and other ancient extinct languages). But there have been advances in our understanding of the neurological substrate for linguistic ability, communication in (some) other species, and in the application of the uniformitarian hypothesis: the processes we now observe in different kinds of language change are themselves capable of producing all the recognized "design features" of human language out of earlier structures in which these features are lacking.

descCRN[10044] = '<p>Although all humans are born with the capacity to learn the sounds of any language, part of learning our native language is learning to categorize sounds into groups specific to that language, thereby filtering out many of the actual phonetic distinctions and concentrating only on those that are important. Just as we, as English speakers, may have trouble hearing the difference between the voiced and voiceless click consonants in Zulu, so speakers of other languages may not hear the difference between the vowels in "beat" and "bit," because this small distinction isn\'t important in their language. Phonology is the study of how different languages organize sounds into perceptual categories. In this class we will look at data from a wide variety of different languages, as well as from several dialects of English, including children\'s acquisition of a phonological system.

The course will focus on dystopia and utopia, misery and joy, in relation to physical or geographic space and time. The texts in this course, although all are “American,” explore what it means to live in a range of times and places that may be hostile or welcoming, or both. Our authors express and represent, and in some cases perform, complex and layered identities that have been shaped by: national origins, regions, class, languages, races and ethnicities, sexualities, genders, experiences of war and other forms of violence, aesthetic experiences of music and literature, and time periods including the future. In the process, they often test or expand the limits of literary, as well as visual and musical, form. We will study works by Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, Tim O’Brien, Alison Bechdel, Octavia Butler, and Janelle Monàe, among others. Course requirements include: an in-class oral presentation, a brief written response to each primary reading, and three essays of about 5-7 pages each (one of which must be revised). This course will fulfill either the foundation course in literature requirement or the literature by U.S. writers of color requirement for the English major.</p>';
descCRN[10070] = '<p>Shakespeare has been called the “star of poets” and “wonder of the stage.” How do his plays delight, puzzle, and instill “wonder”? How did he transform Renaissance poetry? To answer these questions, we will analyze Shakespeare’s formal and stylistic techniques in some of his most celebrated works, including the Sonnets, the comedies (Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, The Tempest), the history plays (Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1), and the tragedies (Macbeth, Hamlet, and Othello). Our study will deepen through class discussions, essays, and performances: watching professional productions and performing scenes from the plays. For centuries, Shakespeare has inspired and challenged writers to imagine and feel in new ways, to perfect their craft and pursue their creative ambitions. You are invited to participate in this exciting and evolving literary tradition. This course fulfills the foundation course requirement for the English major. No prerequisites.</p>';
descCRN[10071] = '<p>*First Year Course only* This first-year course opens with ghost stories from the heyday of the genre: specters and haunts from the pens of nineteenth-century masters, including the likes of Amy Levy, Charles Dickens, Grant Allen, Oscar Wilde, and Emily Bronte. Examining short stories and one novel, we will consider both what terrifies and how. What are the formal qualities of a good ghost story? What are the requirements it places on readers? To what degree are ghosts historically or culturally specific? With these readings for a strong base, the second half of the course considers the legacies of these Victorians. How do the shadows of the past haunt the present, in terms of unhealthy fascinations, or whispers of doubt, or standards of greatness to which a writer must rise? Are modern ghost stories forever in the debt of long-dead writers? How do the Victorians themselves haunt our present moment? Is steampunk or Victorian nostalgia a ghostly presence of the nineteenth century in the twenty-first? This course will ultimately consider both old and new ghost stories, stories that are tied to the nineteenth-century and those that attempt to break free of it, to investigate what is revealed about ourselves or our cultural moments by looking to the narratives of things that haunt us.</p>';
descCRN[10072] = '<p>It is entirely possible for one to analyze the meanings of most texts—their themes, morals, historical significances, and so on—without paying much attention to the formal and linguistic elements that produce such meanings. Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously poeticizes the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up these and other questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. Our readings will draw mainly from British lyric poetry in its different sub-genres—e.g. sonnet, elegy, ode, dramatic monologue, lyrical ballad—but we will also make forays into works from different geographical contexts. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, the type of knowledge (and ignorance) that poetry may or may not offer, and the very question of what poetry is. This course counts as a foundation course toward the English major, but all students are welcome and no prior knowledge or experience is expected.</p>';
descCRN[10073] = '<p>This course explores the concept of beauty in its many forms, from feelings associated with beautiful places and people to the history of visual attraction and attention.  Reading novels from the nineteenth century to the present, we will learn to see beauty from different perspectives and to ask how the visible world intersects with larger social issues.  For example, can the beautiful be political?  What happens to nature\'s beauty in an era of environmental crisis?  And how are shifting gender norms redefining beauty in today\'s world?  The novels we will study critique and analyze these issues even as they revel in the complexity of beauty across time, space, artistic forms, media, and cultures.  Our readings will likely include, among others, Northanger Abbey (Austen), A Picture of Dorian Gray (Wilde), A Room with a View (Forster), Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Joyce), The Hungry Tide (Ghosh), Lucy (Kincaid), and On Beauty (Smith).  Students will write several analytical papers and create a book cover final project.</p>';

Together we’ll read like writers, write like readers, and work the muscles of our imaginations. Our concentrated study of a range of texts will introduce you to the mechanics of fiction, poetry and nonfiction—things like image, voice, character, plot and genre. Frequent writing exercises will help develop your technique, and prepare you to compose a handful of longer, more finished pieces.

descCRN[10080] = '<p>This survey offers both an introduction to medieval and early modern literature and an immersion in current scholarly conversations about the impact of literature on British politics, religion, manners, concepts of gender, and aesthetics. Hwæt is old, middle, and early modern English? How does lyric differ from epic and romance? What’s meter and scansion? When did drama acquire its characteristic structure? What happened to literary writing after the invention of the printing press? We’ll address these questions and many more. Rich in soil but poor in military defense, early England presented an attractive target for foreign invaders. By the tenth century, England had been conquered by the Romans (Julius Caesar: “I came, I saw, I conquered”), the Celts, the Angles, the Saxons, and the Danes. In 1066, William of Normandy emerged as the victor of the Battle of Hastings, inaugurating an era of Norman (French) rule in England. While violent and destructive, each invasion fertilized English culture with new ideas, practices, and languages. For example, the cosmopolitanism of medieval English culture is evident in Chaucer’s poems, which combined French, Italian, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon languages and poetic forms. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, writers including Philip Sidney, Mary Sidney Herbert (Philip’s sister), Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Shakespeare, John Donne, Aemilia Lanyer, Elizabeth Carey, Mary Wroth, and Milton boldly experimented with English poetry, drama, and prose, publishing their works in both manuscript and print. The ascension of King James in 1603 was a watershed moment in the unification of the British Isles. An idea of a British empire, one to rival the Spanish and French, began to take shape. Growing in economic and military power, Britain expanded its boundaries during the seventeenth century. Nationalism in turn inspired fresh debate about what it meant to write, think, act, and live as a “British” subject. <br/></p>';
descCRN[10081] = '<p>To the average person, the field of literary publishing can seem somewhat opaque. How does a novel go from scribbled notes to finished paperback? What goes into editing, printing, and marketing a poetry collection? This course will aim to shed light on this exciting field through a combination of readings, talks with local publishing professionals, in-class discussion, and hands-on work. The centerpiece of the course will involve working with a local writer to produce finished, bound copies of their work. In collaboration with each other and the author, students will edit the work, create publicity and marketing plans, design potential covers, and develop a sales and distribution strategy. We will also explore the history of literary and small press publishing, as well as recent technology trends in the field. This course will be helpful to students considering literary publishing as a profession, writers interested in someday having their own work published, and readers who are curious about what goes into the production of their favorite books.</p>';
descCRN[10082] = '<p>This course will introduce you to a wide variety of long eighteenth-century British literature, from the scabrous and scatological poetry of the second Earl of Rochester to the country house novels of Jane Austen. In the period between the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 and the revolutionary turn of the nineteenth century, writers not only developed a number of new literary genres and reevaluated what counts as literature; they also registered tremendous social and economic changes and grappled with many issues that continue to preoccupy us today, including nationalism, finance capitalism, and the construction of gender identities. In this course we will explore how such issues are shaped in and through the literature of this historical period, paying particular attention to the relation between literary form and the discourses of satire, sensibility, Enlightenment, and liberty. Our readings will range widely across genres, from prose fiction and lyric poetry to philosophical prose, political treatises, and periodical essays, including texts by Jane Austen, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Olaudah Equiano, Eliza Haywood, David Hume, Samuel Johnson, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Alexander Pope, Samuel Richardson, the second Earl of Rochester, Jonathan Swift, and William Wycherley, among others. The course fulfills one of three required courses in pre-1900 literature for English majors.</p>';
descCRN[10083] = '<p>This semester, we will study the literature of Great Britain and Ireland from 1900 to the present.  During this period, the British Isles underwent exciting and radical changes, from the fading of the empire to the emergence of new and contestatory perspectives on race, class, and gender.  In this course, we will pay particular attention to how literary texts can illuminate relationships between place and the political.  We will ask, for instance, how twentieth-century British and Irish texts suggest interactions between built environments (e.g. museums, estate houses, or operating rooms) and processes of social and political change (e.g. world wars, revolution, mass protest, or the rise of the welfare state).  We will also ask, in a related manner, how texts illuminate natural spaces (e.g. bogs, rivers, or islands) as politicized, from providing sites of nostalgia and romance to offering metaphors for civilization and the primitive.  In addition to writing several essays, students will collaborate on a PlaceMaking final project.</p>';
descCRN[10084] = '<p>As the United states lurched toward murderous civil war, a group of passionate, visionary, and bizarre artists set out to discover the soul of America. From 1850 to 1855, in one of the most astonishing creative convergences in literary history, the artists of what would come to be known as the American Renaissance wrote stories and poems that would enlighten, thrill, and terrify generations of readers. With aesthetic wonder and philosophical insight, they revealed both the angels and demons of human nature, inventing a uniquely American spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they damned it all to hell. Their works were spiritual and blasphemous, elegant and profane, beatific and pornographic, irreverently comic and heartwrenchingly sentimental. Everything that was written in America after this period would, in one way or another, have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this small cluster of artists. In this course we will read texts by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN[10087] = '<p>The story goes like this. While performing Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus—a play featuring spell-casting, necromancy, and other devilish arts—the actors noticed that “there was one devil too many amongst them.” They stopped the play; the audience panicked. Whether a true story or not (the anecdote comes down to us through a seventeenth-century source), it captures one of the “certainties” of the period: that demons, devils, witches, and other things of darkness are a part of the here and now. In this course, we explore sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries tales of the demonic. At the same time, we examine how authors used the public’s fascination with the supernatural to explore urgent issues of the day: laws governing service, controversies regarding freewill and election, customs informing rites of hospitality and charity. Hence, just as characters strive to see beyond appearances and outward show, so we shall investigate the religious, political, and legal debates out of which the texts arise. Central to our study are the major works of early modern English literature: Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, Webster’s The White Devil, Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, Shakespeare’s Macbeth and The Tempest, and Milton’s Paradise Lost, and lesser known texts such asThe Witch of Edmonton, The Discovery of Witchcraft, and King James’s Demonology.</p>';
descCRN[10088] = '<p>*First day attendance required* The focus of this course will be on the process of adaptation. We will examine the way novels, short stories, graphic novels, and nonfiction books are transformed into films. Then we will try our hands at some adaption projects of our own. In reading and viewing fiction and film, we will engage in a comparative study of the mediums. Each art has its own ways of creating meaning and telling a story. Each has its own language. Yet, the gap between them is not an unbridgeable one. There are many similarities and comparable tropes and techniques. By studying the methods of this transformation we will come to better understand the process of adapting our own projects. Possible adaptations may include: Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt to Todd Haynes’s Carol, The stories of Raymond Carver to Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman, and Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief to Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation.</p>';

The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.</p>';
descCRN[10091] = '<p>Nineteenth-century Britain saw the explosion of the novel as a genre with many iterations--from gothic adventure to psychological realism, from sensational page-turner to consciousness-raising text. This advanced study of the the novel brings together issues as diverse as the rise of serial fiction, the ways empire served to underpin British culture, and the relationship between rural and urban life. Rather than being focused thematically, the course aims to explore the diversity of genres, audiences, and interests that made up the Victorian novel-reading public, considering such questions as: who was reading and how? What were the material conditions of reading and writing? For whom was reading considered important? Or dangerous? How were novels part of larger cultural conversations, such as debates about the New Woman? How did different sub-genres of the novel appeal to different populations of readers or raise different issues within cultural conversations? Novels on the reading list include: Northanger Abbey, Jane Eyre, The Mill on the Floss, Lady Audley\'s Secret, She, Tess of the d\'Urbervilles, The Romance of a Shop, and some excerpts of Dickens\'s serialized fiction. We will also read other nineteenth-century documents that provide a sense of the frameworks in which these novels appeared, as well as select theoretical and scholarly materials.</p>';
descCRN[10092] = '<p>Suffering deforms and destroys language, turning articulated sound into inarticulate sobs and groans. But suffering also accelerates language, calling into being not only fervent acts of supplication and prayer but also the ornate literary and cultural lament. This course examines the relationship between literature and violations of human rights. How does literature represent the shock that results from witnessing bodies opened in torture and on the battlefield? How does it represent the trauma of peacetime structural violence and domestic injury? What kinds of suffering are more difficult to narrate and why? How can we use language to alleviate suffering or to decelerate group violence? We will consider the variety of ways authors and cultural theorists have attempted to speak the unspeakable, paying particular attention to the relationships among pain, belief, and the body. Authors of interest may include Edwidge Danticat, Junot Diaz, Nathan Englander, Julia Alvarez, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, John Edgar Wideman, and others.</p>';

descCRN[10111] = '<p>*First Year Course only; cross-listed with PHIL 194-01*  From driverless cars to wearable computers, from microwave ovens to mobile phones and tabletop robots, we all live and think in an environment saturated by the products of engineering thinking. But, what does it mean to think?  And what does it mean to think like an engineer?  In this course, team-taught between a mathematician with a background in engineering and a philosopher of technology, you will have an opportunity to explore questions such as these. The course will be grounded in an emerging understanding of engineering as an interdisciplinary field, where design problems are not solely technical, but are inseparable from ethical, social, political, economic, and historical dimensions. We will begin the course with a reading about engineering by the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, and end by looking at debates over engineering for human enhancement. In between, you’ll have the opportunity to read and discuss works by both philosophers and engineers. You’ll learn how values can be unintentionally embedded into engineered objects that reinforce gender and other stereotypes, but can also be consciously embedded for the aims of social justice and sustainability. You will be making arguments and also be making things, including a team-developed engineering project. Your path in this course will be illuminated by discussions about electrical power, solar energy, and lightbulb design. All students are welcome, both those who are interested in pursuing their academic interests in design, engineering, ethics, and/or philosophy,  or those who want to better understand the engineered world as a consumer, citizen, or simply as a reflective human being.<br/></p>';

Assisted reproductive technologies, including donor gametes, genetic testing, and germ line editing, as well as new approaches to pregnancy prevention, reflect advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying reproductive biology. Such technologies create new options in treating infertility and preventing disease and simultaneously raise ethical questions that must be addressed. After an introduction to the physiology of reproduction, this course will use primary literature to examine the science and medicine behind reproductive technologies and medications, contraception and abortion, and the social, legal and ethical issues raised in these rapidly changing fields of medicine.

Some relevant questions that can be answered here are the following: how do consumers choose to allocate their resources between two different goods? What role do prices and income play in these decisions? How do firms choose their production scale and their inputs to production? Why should we worry about monopolies? Are their choices "efficient"? If they are not, can the government do something? In macroeconomics, the focus shifts towards the behavior of consumers and firms as an aggregate. Some relevant questions that can be answered here are the following: what causes unemployment? Why are standards of living a lot better today than 50 years ago? (Or, for that matter, 200 years ago?) Why do some countries grow over time, but others don\'t? Why are there (economic) recessions and booms? What role does money play into this?

The combustion of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps energy near Earth’s surface and leads to warmer average global temperatures. The combustion of fossil fuels also forms the backbone of the modern economy, fueling cars, power plants, and everything in between. This team-taught course will provide a framework in which to consider the costs and benefits of fossil fuel consumption in the present, but also over the coming decades and centuries. We will use concepts from climate science and environmental economics to help evaluate existing and proposed policy interventions designed to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and we will similarly consider possible technological solutions to slow or even reverse climate change. We will spend a significant amount of time exploring how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models. Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics. We hope to attract a diverse group of students with varying academic interests; the only prerequisite for this course is ECON 119: Principles of Economics. Students registering for the course as ECON 294 will receive credit toward the general distribution requirement in social sciences; those registering for ENVI 294 will receive credit towards the natural science requirement.

Why has China been growing so fast in the last three decades? What are the keys to develop a successful business in China? How does the emergence of China affect the world economy? This course is designed to answer the above questions using a general framework developed for the Chinese economy. China remains a communist country with a significant legacy of a command economy. But it is also a market<br/>economy. Understanding this mixture - capitalism with Chinese characters - is a major aim of this course. We will begin with several classes on the historical development of the Chinese economy. This includes the nature of the command economy developed during the Maoist era and the period of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping. Then we will investigate the main players of such an economy (central/local governments and various types of firms). The next is to analyze the three growth engines: globalization, industrialization and urbanization, and to show how they are interacted. We will also study the distorted state financial system and its implication on external imbalances. The last part of the course will be on the future of the Chinese economy.  <br/></p>';

What changes occurred throughout history? What was the impact of travel and colonial development on French food and on food in French colonies? And how do France and Francophone cultures engage with contemporary issues of sustainability? Those are some of the questions the course will explore through a variety of fiction and non fiction films, media and texts. The course will explore different cultural aspects of food, from rituals and traditions to specific foods that changed France and the Francophone world. Linking Western and non Western cultures and looking at how different communities engage with the representation, production, circulation and consumption of food will provide a frame to explore creative ways to think about sustainability.

descCRN[10271] = '<p>*First day attendance required* Global media have long been fascinated with images of migrants from the South enduring perilous journeys in their attempts to enter Europe through land or sea. These images have produced series of standard narratives, especially since the 2010s, rather than a deep understanding. With the help of theorists such as Giorgio Agamben, Etienne Balibar, Isotina Ballesterros, Nina Glick-Schiller, Alec Hargreaves, or Sarah Mekdjian, this course will critically analyze mass media images of immigration, juxtaposing them with more nuanced representations from European cinema and literature. Works from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain will be examined to study specific issues (from detention camps in and out of the Schengen space to integration and citizenship of several generations, from cultural exclusions to hospitality, love, and success stories). Each of the major European countries has a different historical, geographical, and economic relationship with the migrants\' countries of origin, and the course will proceed comparatively, seeking not just commonalities but also significant differences among the European countries receiving migrants. Questions of race, ethnicity, gender, race, religion and differences will be important concerns.<br/><br/>The materials for the class are diverse. They include written memoirs and fiction, films, graphic novels, critical essays, and interactive and creative maps such as euborderscapes projects.  Starting with classics that deal directly with immigration such as Werner Fassbinder\'s Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974), the course will carry its analysis forward to current fiction films such as Terraferma (2011) and Samba (2014). In addition, some documentary films (or excerpts from them) such as Kal Touré\'s Victims of our Riches (2006) will be screened for background information.

descCRN[10306] = '<p>*Cross-listed with AMST 225-01*<br/>The history of American Indians is wonderfully complex, but this history is simultaneously fraught with misconceptions and misinterpretations. European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation\'s indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.

descCRN[10312] = '<p>*Cross-listed with AMST 294-05 and WGSS 294-04* Using critical biographies of both well-known and lesser known African American women, this course will examine traditions of 20th century African American women’s activism, the ways in which they have changed over time, and also the interior lives of African Amercican women.  Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance, which coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine.  This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also seeks to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.  We will read biographies of African American women such as Ida B. Wells, Amy Jacques Garvey, Henrietta Lacks, Ella Baker, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Florynce Kennedy, and Barbara Jordan, to name a few.  Biographical reading will be coupled with primary sources, documentaries, and additional secondary sources to provide context.</p>';

We will focus on issues such as family policy, reproductive rights, labor, immigration, women’s political representation, and LGBTQ equality in Europe. We will also explore the importance of children and childhood in the context of contemporary European society and the role that the state has played in shaping the lives of young people. Whenever possible, we will approach the topics at hand by exploring the voices of European women themselves and we will consider the experiences of people from a wide range of identities.

The Vikings were accomplished traders and settlers as well, and they fundamentally altered the political, economic, military, and religious history of northern Europe and beyond. We will use textual, archaeological, and linguistic evidence alongside scholarly works to explore the rich history of the Vikings and their impact.</p>';

This course is designed to answer the above questions using a general framework developed for the Chinese economy. China remains a communist country with a significant legacy of a command economy. But it is also a market economy. Understanding this mixture - capitalism with Chinese characters - is a major aim of this course. We will begin with several classes on the historical development of the Chinese economy. This includes the nature of the command economy developed during the Maoist era and the period of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping. Then we will investigate the main players of such an economy (central/local governments and various types of firms). The next is to analyze the three growth engines: globalization, industrialization and urbanization, and to show how they are interacted. We will also study the distorted state financial system and its implication on external imbalances. The last part of the course will be on the future of the Chinese economy.</p>';

descCRN[10399] = '<p>*First Year Course only* We spend our lives staring at the screens of computers, phones, movies and televisions.  And the amount of time we spend before them is anything but insignificant.  According to the most recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8-18 year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes using entertainment media across a typical day (more than 53 hours a week)!  Because they spend so much of that time "media multitasking" (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to pack a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content into those 7½ hours per day. The screen is one of the most important technological innovations of recent memory, for it has such a wide range of influences on our experience of the everyday. From social media and networking, online video to Hollywood movies, from email to texting, our knowledge of the world is largely mediated by screens. Screens substitute real world experience for a world created in a display of colored lights and accompanying sounds. Given this dependence, what influence do they have on our perception of the world, of others, of ourselves, of news, of reality? Do screens, in fact, contribute to what Anne Friedberg has called a "dematerializing of reality"? Should we be worried about their pervasiveness? In this First Year Course, we will ask these and related questions. We will begin to develop our own answers to them by reading and writing about, analyzing and critiquing various aspects of the media. This course is designed for students who have a strong interest in critical and philosophical type analysis of society and will introduce you to the field of Media Studies in order to help you come to an understanding of the importance of screens in mediating our experience of and interactions with the world.<br/></p>';

Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students’ abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students’ retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material.

We will investigate issues that have affected women\'s participation in musical life, such as musical canons, gendered musical discourse, and gender stereotypes. In addition, we will explore contributions of trans* musicians, as well as issues that affect their musical lives. We will also interrogate constructions of gender, masculinity, and femininity as they relate to music. An ongoing goal will be to develop reading comprehension and critical thinking skills through a series of short summary/response papers and discussion in class.

We will approach the musical works analytically and critically, with the goal of applying our observations about musical form/s to the formation of arguments concerning aesthetics, ethics, politics, culture, and other perspectives. Through readings from a variety of disciplines and traditions, we will develop an understanding of such categories as Classicism, Romanticism, Nationalism, Modernism, and Socialist Realism, both musically and more broadly. Works we will study closely include: by Beethoven--Symphony No. 7, String Quartet in B-flat Major, Opus 130, Piano Sonatas Opus 110 and 111; by Mahler--Symphony No. 3, Das Lied von der Erde (“The Song of the Earth”); by Shostakovich--Symphony No. 4, String Quartet No. 3, Symphony No. 8, the Preludes and Fugues for Piano. In a semester-long independent project, students will write a critical-analytical essay on a topic of their own devising. This course carries the prerequisite of MUSI 114 (Theory II).

descCRN[10428] = '<p>*First Year Course only* What matters in life?  Is pleasure the only thing that matters?  If so, whose pleasure should I seek—just my own, my family’s, or everyone’s? Does suffering matter, too? What about the suffering of non-human animals? Is it okay for me to make animals suffer in order for me to enjoy the pleasure of eating their flesh? Or how about the suffering of people who are really far away from me—say, on another continent? Is it okay for me to spend money on cool stuff for myself when instead I could donate it to help people who are suffering very badly far away?  If things in life other than pleasure matter too, what are they? People who oppose torture think that it’s wrong to hurt one person really badly even in order to prevent a large number of people from being hurt.  Are they right?  Is it always wrong to treat someone as merely a means to an end? Is it in general wrong to do things to people without their consent?  Why?  When do people deserve to be praised or blamed for their actions? What kind of person should I be?  Should I try to be happy? Or should I try to be virtuous? Is virtue its own reward? Or are we all inevitably faced with a choice between being virtuous and being happy?  If we are faced with that choice, which one should we pick?

descCRN[10435] = '<p>*First Year Course only* This introductory philosophy course focuses on the nature and scope of our personal boundaries, specifically the intersections between mind, body, and self. Questions about the nature of these three and the relationship between them have a long pedigree in the history of philosophy. We will therefore ground our explorations in the work of classical thinkers such as Descartes, Locke and Hume. These philosophers were especially interested in how minds and bodies are related, and how this mind-body relationship gives us a sense of being a self that endures through time. Yet we live in a time where our personal boundaries are being transformed and challenged in interesting ways, specifically by the technologies that are becoming an integral part of our daily lives. These technologies have opened up new possibilities and new ways of thinking about the nature of mind, body, and self. Artificial minds in artificial bodies now seem a real possibility, as do artificial enhancements of biological minds and minds that extend beyond the skull to incorporate aspects of the environment (smartphones and facebook pages, for example). Such developments begin to blur the boundaries between biology and technology, and hence the boundaries between mind and world, between self and not-self. We will explore these topics through a variety of print and film media and, in doing so, work to develop the critical and analytical skills of each participant in the course.</p>';
descCRN[10436] = '<p>*Cross-listed with RELI 212-01*<br/>Philosophical analysis of problems in religion and theology such as arguments for the existence of God and the nature of religious knowledge. The Philosophy of Religion seeks an understanding of religion by raising philosophical questions about its underlying assumptions and implications. When we believe something it is because we think it is true and because we think we have good evidence to support our belief. In the case of religious beliefs, however, we are immediately faced with questions concerning the nature of such beliefs. What claims do they make? What would count as good evidence for a religious belief? What is the nature of religious truth? In this course we will examine the nature of religious beliefs and the ways in which philosophers in different traditions have justified or argued against such beliefs. Perhaps in response to the increasing challenge to religion from the natural sciences, twentieth century philosophers have questioned the traditional philosophical approach to religion. Some philosophers, Wittgenstein for example, question traditional interpretations of religious language and re-examine the relationship between faith and reason. Can religious life be practiced without a theology or with skepticism or agnosticism regarding theological questions? Other topics covered in the course include the attempt to introduce intelligent design into public schools as part of the science curriculum; religious pluralism; the belief in life after death; and feminist critiques of religious language.

But, what does it mean to think?  And what does it mean to think like an engineer?  In this course, team-taught between a mathematician with a background in engineering and a philosopher of technology, you will have an opportunity to explore questions such as these. The course will be grounded in an emerging understanding of engineering as an interdisciplinary field, where design problems are not solely technical, but are inseparable from ethical, social, political, economic, and historical dimensions. We will begin the course with a reading about engineering by the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, and end by looking at debates over engineering for human enhancement. In between, you’ll have the opportunity to read and discuss works by both philosophers and engineers. You’ll learn how values can be unintentionally embedded into engineered objects that reinforce gender and other stereotypes, but can also be consciously embedded for the aims of social justice and sustainability. You will be making arguments and also be making things, including a team-developed engineering project. Your path in this course will be illuminated by discussions about electrical power, solar energy, and lightbulb design.

descCRN[10438] = '<p>*Cross-listed with ENVI 221-01*<br/>Emerging in the 1970s, the field of environmental ethics began by sparking a rich line of philosophical inquiry largely focused on the moral status of the natural world and the non-human entities within it.

Do we have moral duties to individuals within a species, or to species themselves, or to ecosystems, or to...? This course will invite you to reflect on key philosophical works that engage these and related questions.

descCRN[10451] = '<p>Einstein’s theory of general relativity speaks to the imagination of many. This famous theory resolves in a beautiful way the dilemmas that arise at the cross-section of special relativity and Newton’s theory of gravity. Some of its more exotic consequences, such as the existence of black holes, are a staple of science fiction literature. However, general relativity is now a well-established physical theory, supported by a large number of measurements, including the recent observation of gravitational waves emitted in a black hole merger event. <br/>This course will give a quantitative introduction to general relativity. We will start the course by reviewing Newton’s theory of gravity and special relativity. We will then explore what goes wrong at the interface where these two theories meet. General relativity provides a consistent resolution of these problems that requires a bold new perspective; gravity is no longer understood in terms of forces that massive objects exert on each other. Instead, the presence of matter is seen to curve space-time, and in turn objects follow geodesic trajectories in this curved space-time. In mathematical terms, general relativity is therefore most naturally cast in the form of geometry.<br/> <br/>We will then discuss some of the more symmetric types of curved space-times, in particular those that are described by the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild metric and the isotropic and homogeneous Robertson-Walker metric. A firm understanding of these specific cases will allow us to explore a large number of interesting applications, such as precision tests of general relativity within the Solar system, for example the perihelion shift of Mercury, and more exotic topics such as black holes, gravitational lensing, and cosmology, the evolution of the Universe as a whole.</p>';

As citizens, how ought we respond to campaign discourse that demeans, denigrates, and dissembles?<br/>The study of campaign rhetoric prompts us to ask important questions about this extraordinary election cycle:<br/>·         What should we make of Donald Trump, who countenances violence in his campaign speeches?<br/>·         How can communication theory explain Bernie Sanders’ phenomenal fundraising and electoral successes?<br/>·         Why have so many Republican candidates tried to mock and emasculate one another during their debate performances?<br/>·         Should the sound of Hillary Clinton’s voice or her sometimes serious demeanor disqualify her from becoming the first US female president?<br/>·         Why does the language of incivility run so rampant in this election?<br/>We will also take up other questions that extend beyond 2016:<br/>·         How big a role do social media play in American elections?<br/>·         How important are campaign advertisements? Are they worth their massive cost?<br/>·          Why has the Supreme Court ruled that campaign contributions constitute political speech?<br/>This course operates at two levels: 1) in class with your peers, you will analyze the wide variety of persuasive language, symbols, and communication strategies undertaken by presidential candidates; and 2) on your own, you will produce different types of campaign rhetoric for your assignments.<br/>The U.S. Census Bureau projects that “the United States will become a majority-minority nation for the first time in 2043. While the non-Hispanic white population will remain the largest single group, no group will make up a majority.”[1] Each of you will act as if you have been hired as the campaign or communication manager for a “down ballot” candidate who is currently running for office. Bearing the Census Bureau’s demographic data in mind, I will encourage (but not require) you to produce your hypothetical campaign rhetoric assignments on behalf of a candidate who belongs to a new emigrant group or to an historically marginalized group. In this way, you will more fully understand the racial, gendered, and class dimensions of American politics and what it takes to elect public servants who better reflect America’s heterogeneous population.<br/>Your assignments include producing press releases, a 30-second radio ad, a candidate stump speech, a prospectus for institutional donors, online fundraising appeals, campaign literature, and scripts for fundraising phone banks.<br/>We will hear from a number of guest lecturers.

descCRN[10504] = '<p>*Cross-listed with PHIL 212-01*<br/>Philosophical analysis of problems in religion and theology such as arguments for the existence of God and the nature of religious knowledge. The Philosophy of Religion seeks an understanding of religion by raising philosophical questions about its underlying assumptions and implications. When we believe something it is because we think it is true and because we think we have good evidence to support our belief. In the case of religious beliefs, however, we are immediately faced with questions concerning the nature of such beliefs. What claims do they make? What would count as good evidence for a religious belief? What is the nature of religious truth? In this course we will examine the nature of religious beliefs and the ways in which philosophers in different traditions have justified or argued against such beliefs. Perhaps in response to the increasing challenge to religion from the natural sciences, twentieth century philosophers have questioned the traditional philosophical approach to religion. Some philosophers, Wittgenstein for example, question traditional interpretations of religious language and re-examine the relationship between faith and reason. Can religious life be practiced without a theology or with skepticism or agnosticism regarding theological questions? Other topics covered in the course include the attempt to introduce intelligent design into public schools as part of the science curriculum; religious pluralism; the belief in life after death; and feminist critiques of religious language.

descCRN[10505] = '<p>*First Year Course only* This course provides students with a critical perspective in interpreting social inequalities in the US. Mainly the course will have students debate two perspectives on the social origins of inequality and the political and ethical consequences such perspectives embody. The first is what we will call the internalist/culture of poverty thesis which explains inequalities in terms of characteristics belonging to particular groups (e.g., cultural or religious beliefs, socialization and childrearing practices, educational and vocabulary attainment, modernizationist discourse of developed and underdeveloped societies…). The second perspective we will explore is the relational/structural theory of social and global inequality. Sociologists of this sort prefer to focus on asymmetrical power relations between groups (e.g., symbolic markers of distinctions; cultural capital; the social construction of gender, class, and race; core-periphery capitalist relations between poor and rich countries…).  The objective of the course is to provide students with sophisticated sociological studies on both sides of the debate dealing with inequalities. The course attempts to demonstrate that even though many of the authors we cover apply social scientific methods, the fact that they come at the same empirical evidence from different theoretical perspectives ultimately determines their interpretation and understanding of the causes of social inequalities. Here students may discover that the lens through which they look may turn out to be a political, moral, and ethical choice.  For the second objective, students discover that these two perspectives, when combined, may provide an alternative perspective than either has to offer in isolation. For instance, instead of seeing socialization practices of the poor as tied to lack of objective skills required to become upwardly mobile, the student can learn to combine this perspective with the structural perspective so as to see those skills not simply as objective characteristics but as socially constructed – in other words as symbolic markers of distinctions (i.e., as class, race, gender performances) used unconsciously by the elite of the world to reproduce their class, gender, and racial dominance. This way, as Julie Bettie has argued in her Women Without Class, instead of seeing certain “cultural traits” as dysfunctional or pathological and blaming a specific group, the focus is on changing social and global cultural constructs of rich and poor that produces poverty and inequality in the first place. It is the highly racialized, genderized, and classed constructs of social inequalities that have to be first deconstructed before we can hope to alleviate those inequalities. Hence, “culture” is a big part of the story, maybe just not in the way many of us think it is.<br/></p>';

Wright Mills dscribed it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples\' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology).

descCRN[10507] = '<p>This course will focus primarily on how fears spread and become a major public concern. We will deal with a number of issues like pedophilia (including priests and pedophilia), gangs, drug scares, and terrorism. Sociologists have long studied these moral panics -- defined as public campaigns to elicit alarm about perceived threats to social order. We will adopt this perspective to see that indeed issues like these do not become part of public discourse naturally from the threat itself. Rather, we will ask what does power have to do with it becoming a public concern? What kinds of narrations are utilized to make it available to us in a particular way? Who gets to define these public threats and who becomes its object of concern? Who does it blame and who does it protect from ridicule?  Why do fears and panics usually flow down the power structure, rarely focusing on dominant races and social classes and all too often on the weak, poor, minorities, or the global Other? A major sub theme of the course will be to trace the incitement process through certain networks and what sociologists call “claims makers” and “moral entrepreneurs” (think tanks, groups like Jihad Watch, the State-Security Industrial complex, political elites, human rights groups . . . ), especially right wing groups but also including liberals, mainstream feminists, gay rights activists, and security "experts." We will also be interested in the way these politically orchestrated fears impact the way we understand cultural differences, human rights, immigration, culture and crime, gender inequality, patriarchy, domestic abuse, military occupation, and so on, often in ways that perpetuates Orientalist and problematic classifications of racial and cultural divides.</p>';

Sexuality and its components (desire, pleasure, love, the body) is something more than a personal or individual characteristic. It is socially constructed. Sexuality has been configured during different historical time periods as sin, as a means of fostering alliances between powerful families, as perversion, as a means to pleasure, as a symbol of love, and as personal identity. These different sexual configurations are connected with larger social-historical trends such as the development of capitalism, the use of rationalized technologies, and the expansion of scientific-medical discourse. In this course, we explore how sexuality has been constructed through history. We examine how categories shape our understanding of sexuality such as male/female, heterosexual/homosexual/queer. We also will address issues such as child sexuality, prostitution, images of sexual minorities in the media and heteronormativity. (4 credits) <br/></p>';

descCRN[10511] = '<p>In popular discourse, the category of class is often missing, misunderstood as temporary and not institutionalized, displaced onto other discourses of difference such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, or mystified within an ideology of individualism. In this course, we adopt a sociological lens to examine the systematic operation of class divisions through cultural mediums, considering how class identities become formulated and class cultures become differentiated within varying institutional contexts. Our study will track the category of class along multiple lines of cultural distinction, examining class subjectivity as it is constructed in relation to gender, race, and sexuality identity, and as it is built around moral discourses of difference and symbolic economies of style, taste, and preference. We will address key theories and questions in the sociology of class as we examine how class meanings are articulated in class-specific attitudes, values, behaviors, and practices, considering how these meanings become distributed, internalized, and ‘activated’ through processes that often render those meanings ‘natural.’ We will discuss our relationship to the class cultures in which we live, and the relationship between class culture, cultural capital, and power, considering both how class culture operates in micro-interactional settings on the basis of widely shared class-cultural beliefs, and how it can exist in more clearly defined institutional settings such as family, school and work, leisure and consumption. The course moves from considering broad questions in the field to an examination of selected empirical works, where we look closely at how class culture operates to construct identities and distinctions among groups. Our study will carry us from working class kids whose culture of rebellion sets them up for working class jobs, to middle class families whose ‘concerted cultivation’ of their children imparts distinct advantages over their working class counterparts; from high school girls whose class identity is constructed in relationship to color, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, to the halls of an elite boarding school where elite youth train to be cultural omnivores able to inhabit privilege with carefully cultivated ease.

descCRN[10535] = '<p>*First Year Course only* The movies love to hate the Nazi, but what exactly is a “Nazi”?  Whether glamorized by Third Reich propaganda, vilified by allied propaganda, dramatized by historical thrillers, or caricatured by Hollywood fantasies, the cinematic Nazi is always a construct.  This is not to say there may not be some historical, psychological, or sociological truth in the depiction of Nazis, but their filmic portrayal, like that of any historical group, necessarily involves construction or representation.  And representations tend to tell us more about the era in which they were concocted than about the “real” thing.  Consciously or unconsciously, they serve a purpose: to educate, to entertain, to complicate or (over)simplify our understanding of history, to thrill, disturb, or affirm us as viewers.   The course will examine the questions of representation using the example of the cinematic Nazi—one case among hundreds, but an important one, as the Nazi has become the symbol of evil over the past half-century. The first part of the course will focus on films from the historical period of the Third Reich.  We will examine how the Nazis represent themselves in documentaries like Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will or Fritz Hippler’s The Eternal Jew, as well as feature films like Hitler Youth Quex.  We will then turn to U.S. counter-propaganda in dramas like Tomorrow the World, in comedies like Chaplin’s Great Dictator or Lubitsch’s To Be Or Not To Be and in Disney cartoons.  Later we will explore postwar representations; likely examples will include Billy Wilder’s A Foreign Affair, Mel Brooks’s The Producers, Oliver Hirschbiegel’s Downfall, Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds.  Student obligations: a series of short papers and one longer research paper; at least one oral presentation. Two exams and in-class free-writing.   Hopefully the Twin Cities will offer some cultural events relevant to our theme that we can visit as a class. N.B.: The course is taught in English and films are subtitled; no German language skills required.

descCRN[10541] = '<p>*Cross-listed with ENGL 394-02 and MCST 337-01*<br/>Today we often hear people dismiss the Western (mostly European) philosophical tradition as a bunch of “dead white men.” In other words, the argument goes, these thinkers harbored such passe notions as universal truths, a universal subject, and an individual in total control of itself and endowed with a pure reason unadulterated by rhetoric, imagination, fiction, and politics. Why should we bother with “dead white men” now that we understand that truth depends on historical context, that the self is decentered by the unconscious, that identity is constituted by gender, race, class, and other cultural factors, that truth is linked to power, and that ideology is omnipresent? Unfortunately, this all-too-familiar attitude overlooks its own faulty presupposition: it presumes a clear-cut break between philosophical tradition and contemporary thought, as if contemporary thought had no tradition out of which it emerged and could, therefore, merely discard what preceded it. Hence the popularity of phrases like “philosophy is dead.” It is all the more ironic to see this attitude prevail in the West at the very moment that multiculturalism has become our cause celebre : all cultural traditions are supposed to be “respected,” except the West’s own tradition. (Perhaps as a new way for the West to reinstate surreptitiously its superiority as the sole culture with no tradition?) This course pursues a close reading of texts by various “dead white men” as the unconscious (i.e., repressed and, for that matter, all the more powerful) undercurrent of contemporary thought.

descCRN[10607] = '<p>With the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960’s and Feminist Movement of the 1970’s, and an increasingly diverse population, U.S. society has become more accepting of individuals from various groups and backgrounds. However, prejudice and discrimination continue to exist today, often in more subtle forms. This course will examine from a social psychological perspective the causes and consequences of stereotypes (beliefs about group members), prejudice (evaluations of group members), and discrimination (behaviors towards individuals based on their group membership). Students will use materials from books, scholarly research articles, and video/film clips to explore topics such as the origins of stereotypes and prejudice, contemporary and implicit forms of prejudice, characteristics specific to racism and sexism, development of prejudice through childhood and adolescence, coping with being members from stigmatized groups, evaluating interventions for combating prejudice and discrimination, and so on. Overall, this course is designed to provide an intellectual forum for discussing these concepts in a fairly comprehensive manner, and we will rely on scientific experiments and theories that explain the behavior of the individual with respect to social groups.

Why don\'t many Deaf people consider themselves “disabled?” What might we learn from shifting the “problem” of disability from the individual person to the social environment? This course will explore these and many other questions that emerge from thinking about the experience of disability (and its intersection with identities based on gender, race, class, and sexuality).  Grounded in a critical disability and Deaf studies framework that considers the socially, culturally, linguistically, and historically constructed meaning of physical, sensory, and cognitive “impairments,” the course will rely on theoretical and empirical readings from psychology and related disciplines, memoir, film, and guest visitors as we explore the social and psychological meanings of disability.

Our classroom is on campus and our laboratories are a bus ride away!<br/>In this course, we will learn and practice the skill of "complex seeing" as audiences of live performance.  We will work against our pre-assigned roles as mere consumers of visual culture, and instead become aware of our capacities as meaning-makers in the performance environment.  Starting as readers of written texts (plays), we\'ll advance to readings of the live, and fleeting, event of performance itself.  We\'ll consider crucial questions.  Why read plays?  How do we "read" dance?  What is the use of critiquing a performance that is "over"?   What does "over" mean, if we still derive pleasure in memory?  What are the theoretical frameworks we need to advocate for performance\'s role in broad cultural work and social change?  What is the work of performance in our highly, hyper-, mediated and virtual experience of "the real"?  Does Hamilton suggest widespread hunger, enthusiasm, for staging history?  We will read, attend, discuss, meet theatre artists, practice thinking and writing about performance.  Welcome to college in the Twin Performance Cities!<br/></p>';

The course interrogates the aesthetic and cultural operations of theatre and the dramatic arts in order to identify vocabularies for interpreting the EVENT of the theatre. At its core, the course addresses the question: what does it require to read and interpret the arts of the theatre, theatrical contexts, and its performances? Using scripts, recorded events, criticism, and theory, the course addresses the rich relationship between the HISTORY and the THEORY of theatre and performance practices. (4 credits)</p>';

However, as this seminar suggests, well-thought theory is rooted in material practice inasmuch as performance practice is rooted in thinking and theorizing.  The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to a wide array of critical theorists and theoretical approaches with a particular emphasis on how these approaches are bound to the study and practice of theatre and performance.  The seminar is not a comprehensive course that investigates any one theoretical field in detail and to its fullest complexity.  Rather, we will work to closely read texts from a broad range of critical approaches, to connect theoretical approaches to material practices, and to understand theory through our own embodiment.  The readings are situated in fields such as Feminist/Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Critical Theory, and Eco-Criticism.

Do we have moral duties to individuals within a species, or to species themselves, or to ecosystems, or to...? This course will invite you to reflect on key philosophical works that engage these and related questions.

The combustion of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps energy near Earth’s surface and leads to warmer average global temperatures. The combustion of fossil fuels also forms the backbone of the modern economy, fueling cars, power plants, and everything in between. This team-taught course will provide a framework in which to consider the costs and benefits of fossil fuel consumption in the present, but also over the coming decades and centuries. We will use concepts from climate science and environmental economics to help evaluate existing and proposed policy interventions designed to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and we will similarly consider possible technological solutions to slow or even reverse climate change. We will spend a significant amount of time exploring how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models. Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics. We hope to attract a diverse group of students with varying academic interests; the only prerequisite for this course is ECON 119: Principles of Economics.

In this class, we will ask: What are the Japanese modern and postmodern? How might Japanese art, design, media and spaces be understood not only through the lens of Japanese history over the last 150 years but as part of transnational movements? To answer these questions, this course explores prewar and postwar trends in Japanese visual culture, including painting, prints, sculpture, architecture, fashion, anime (Japanese cartoons), film, photography, advertising design, sculpture, and manga (Japanese comics). Through these various artistic forms and media, we will explore themes such as trauma, nationalism, fascism, protest, hybridity, fantasy, embodiment, and performativity.

This forced migration shaped the cultures that emerged in North and South America and have an ongoing impact on modern political, social, and economic life. <br/>In this class we will analyze the trans-Atlantic slave trade in historical context.  What were the conditions in the Atlantic world that led to the rise of this long-distance trade in humans?  How does the transatlantic slave trade compare to other forms of enslavement in history and the present?  How did children experience enslavement?  What role did gender play in the lives of enslaved people? What agency did the enslaved seize and how did people create community in the midst of oppression? Why and how did the transatlantic trade in slaves end?<br/>We will consider the problems of locating and analyzing relevant primary sources as well as interrogating various methods and theories scholars have employed in seeking to understand the trade and its effects.

This ubiquity of computing devices, many of which are embedded inside common appliances, has given rise to the phrase the “Internet of Things”, or IoT. This computer science course, which will count for the major and take the place of COMP 123, will emphasize exploration and discovery of the breadth of computer science through the use of a microcomputer called the Raspberry Pi (RPi for short). The processor in a Raspberry Pi is found in many types of devices, such that learning how to program using it will give students an appreciation for how to design applications for devices on embedded computers. At the same time, the RPi is a fully functioning computer, and programming with it is the same as programming for any laptop. Students will have full-time, 24/7 use of the computer and its peripherals, which can be stowed in a small toolbox, for the entire semester.

These bases for performance challenge conventional play-wrighting and, as Della Pollock declares, "expand upon traditional ways of transmitting historical knowledge."  Oral history/-based performance often breaks new performance ground, especially for issues and underrepresented bodies/voices lacking access to traditional performance economics and audiences.  We will study the ethics advocated, and practices developed, by major figures in the field of oral history and oral history-based performance, including Studs Terkel, Augusto Boal, Anna Deavere Smith, Roger Guenveur Smith, and the choreographer Ralph Lemon.  Students will develop projects in designing and creating new oral history performance and, if they are so inclined, moving their texts into performance.  (This course is superb preparation for a major oral history-based performance in THDA in Spring 2017, on themes of nursing, emotional labor, and public health;  students interested in ethnographic methods are encouraged to enroll in this course even if they cannot participate in the Spring production.)</p>';

Students will be introduced to the elements of surface anatomy and structure of the human body through working with nude and clothed models, the skeleton, anatomical texts, and other source material. Confidence, the ability to improvise, and an expressive connection with the figure will be encouraged through exercises that encourage experimentation with gesture and materials. In an in-depth, independent final project, students will develop their own personal content related to the figure/body, using the materials and methods of their choice. Discussion of the various issues brought up by representation of the body will be part of our study of both contemporary and historical works of art. Every other fall. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10837] = '<p>*First day attendance required*<br/>This course examines the role of Education as global phenomena. The course encompasses a comparative view of education around the world, as well as its role in International Development. We take it further, by analysis and critique, to understand education as a force for change in an inter-dependent, globalized world. Specifically, we will examine ways in which policies and practice either enhance or diminish efforts towards change that is inclusive, just, sustainable and effective in relieveing suffering, while expanding potential and capacity in those affected by social change. We take the position that, in order to be effective, building trust becomes a key to connectivity between people, groups, organizations and ideas where education, development and change are theorized and practiced. We will construct possible education frameworks around the idea of building trust, by analyzing socio-cultural issues of power, voice, silence, and discourse. Fall semester. (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN[10844] = '<p>Wealth has held an allure for many modern thinkers; the creation of a wealthy society often associated with "civilization" itself. The relationships among work, wealth and well-being are a perennial concern and have been central to the study of political economy, since its inception in the mid- to late-18th century. How does work produce wealth for the individual and for society? How, or when, does individual and social wealth translate into individual and/or social well-being? And, how does the character of work affect individual well-being or happiness? This course will examine the answers given to these questions (and myriad corollary questions) by writers within the political economy tradition. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10845] = '<p>In 2014, with very little fanfare, China took over the United States as the world’s largest economic power. Even though its economic performance has been erratic ever since, China’s rise has prompted many in the West to fear the possibility of a new global hegemony. Indeed, today the global center of economic and geopolitical gravity seems to be rapidly shifting towards countries like China and India, which just three decades ago were near the bottom of the economic heap. Does the dramatic ascent of China and India as global economic powers signal a turning point in the structure of the modern world economy? What, precisely, is \'miracular\' about Asia’s success, and does it come, as Donald Trump and others so vociferously insist, at the expense of the well-being of the U.S. economy? Does China’s claim to be a “socialist” economy suggest an alternative model of economic development? Does it alter our conceptions of capitalism and market economies? Do we indeed live, as Margaret Thatcher insisted, in a world where “there is no alternative,” or do China and India’s models of growth suggest that another world is indeed possible? Yet, Asia’s spectacular rise is not without its own tensions and contradictions: its growth trajectories have been accompanied by sharp inequalities in human wellbeing and access to resources, economic stagnation and debt bubbles, depopulated ghost towns, its own forms of imperialism, and rising worker unrest and suicides accompanied by violent state efforts to neutralize dissent. By all these accounts, then, Asia’s place in the world economic system is anything but settled. This course will tackle some of these issues and questions that arise from Asia’s meteoric economic growth. We will read widely in political economy, world-systems theory and development theory, placing our theoretical questions alongside recent empirical research on China and India’s manufacturing industries and their roles in global supply chains, Foxconn and Indian farmer suicides, China’s imperialism in Africa, agro-industrialization, urban-rural migration, and much more.</p>';
descCRN[10846] = '<p>How and why does race matter politically in Canada, Mexico, and the United States? What are the historical, ideological, and cultural roots of the racial politics we observe today? Which political theories and interpretive frameworks help us to best understand the many ways race matters? How does race intersect with other internal or external markers of identity? In addressing these questions, our objects of study will be the philosophical and empirical origins of what David Theo Goldberg has called “The Racial State.” Starting from the settler-colonial context in North America but with an emphasis on twentieth and twenty-first century race politics, the course will examine theoretical approaches to the intersections of race, ethnicity, and gender. The course will include readings from writers concerned with Blackness, Chicanx/Mestizo/Latino/a identities, Indigeneity, and queer and feminist theory and practice. Students will be required to complete weekly ungraded writing assignments which will be used to generate class discussion, practice critical questioning, and clarify students’ ideas in preparation for longer essays.</p>';

Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance, which coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine.  This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also seeks to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.  We will read biographies of African American women such as Ida B.

In this course, we will first deconstruct the idea of Asia as a cartographic entity to excavate the layered social-cultural meaning and geographical diversity of the “Asias.” We will also place the “Asias” in a global context to reveal how contemporary Asia anchors the changing world political economy and cultural imaginations outside the West. We will begin with important theoretical debates on (East) Asian development that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s, including discussions about the colonial past, the path-dependency of development and uneven industrialization, regional disparities and mega-urbanization. We will then use these debates as the foundation to explore the contemporary globalizing Asia. What are the important connections between Asian countries, and with other parts of the world? What are the role of the “Asias” in international governance and geo-politics? Can China replace the United States as the dominant geo-economic power? These are the questions we will explore in this course.</p>';

descCRN[10947] = '<p>This course is designed as a basic introduction to digital video production. The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces.

descCRN[30036] = '<p>*Cross-listed with ENVI 375-01; first day attendance required*<br/>This course introduces students to Rural Geography, a sub-discipline within Geography. Using a sustainable development framework this course emphasizes the linkages between human and physical landscapes through the evaluation of landuse and community change in rural areas throughout the US. We will explore the implications of demographic (including migration and immigration), economic, cultural, and environmental changes for rural environs using several case studies from across the US and Western Europe, including an overnight field trip to northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Rural community strategies for adapting to and accommodating competing demands for water and landuse will be considered, including pressure for new housing developments, recreation opportunities (boating, fishing, hiking, biking), and conservation needs. Students will be exposed to theoretical and empirical approaches to rural development in different regional contexts, as well as problems associated with these development paradigms. We will explore the rapidly changing rural environments in a developed world context in order to deepen our understanding of the interconnectedness of human and physical systems more broadly.

descCRN[30041] = '<p>The aim of this course is to make you aware of the complex organization and systematic nature of language, the primary means of human communication. In a sense, you will be studying yourself, since you are a prime example of a language user. Most of your knowledge of language, however, is unconscious, and the part of language that you can describe is largely the result of your earlier education, which may have given you confused, confusing, or misleading notions about language. This course is intended to clarify your ideas about language and bring you to a better understanding of its nature. By the end of the course you should be familiar with some of the terminology and techniques of linguistic analysis and be able to apply this knowledge to the description of different languages. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30042] = '<p>This course deals with the formal properties of discourse organization above the word level. Using local English as our test case, we introduce and refine the conceptual apparatus of theoretical syntax: syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic categories, the ways they are coded in English, phrase structure rules and recursion, semantic and pragmatic motivations for formal structures, movement rules, anaphora, and dependence relations. Some properties of English are (probable) language universals. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30044] = '<p>*6 credit course*<br/>The vast majority of the world\'s languages cannot be learned from textbooks or programmed tapes. They have never even been recorded.

(4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30045] = '<p>Languages are constantly changing. The English written by Chaucer 600 years ago is now very difficult to understand without annotation, not to mention anything written a few centuries before that. This course investigates the nature of language change, how to determine a language\'s history, its relationship to other languages and the search for common ancestors or "proto-languages." We will discuss changes at various linguistic levels: sound change, lexical change, syntactic change and changes in word meaning over time. Although much of the work done in this field involves Indo-European languages, we will also look at change in many other language families. This is a practical course, most of class time will be spent DOING historical linguistics, rather than talking about it. We will be looking at data sets from many different languages and trying to make sense of them. In the cases where we have examples of many related languages, we will try to reconstruct what the parent language must have looked like. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30046] = '<p>Nearly all natural languages are spoken. Biological properties of the human ear, pharynx, larynx, tongue, and lung impose limits on the sounds of human languages, which can be studied from both a biological and an acoustic point of view. In this course you will be trained to produce and recognize (almost) all the sounds which human languages make use of, and to develop a systematic way of analyzing and recording them. Since sounds are perceived as well as produced, you will also be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech, learning how acoustic signals of frequency, amplitude, and duration are translated into visible, quantifiable images. You will learn the art of decoding these spectrograms into sounds and words and sentences. The linguistics laboratory contains several different programs for practicing and listening to sounds from many of the world\'s languages. This course is recommended for students of foreign languages, drama, music and anyone who wants to become more aware of their (and other people\'s) pronunciation. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30048] = '<p>We are living in the midst of an "irony epidemic," where two of the most frequently used expressions in current American English are "like" and "whatever." Both of these are literally advertisements that words are not the real thing (at best, they are "like" it), and that they don\'t matter (since "whatever" you say is equally a matter of indifference). This course takes as its point of departure the sarcasm and irony in spoken American English, and proceeds to an investigation of how the peculiar message of sarcasm ("I don\'t mean this") is conveyed in other languages, and in the media. Not surprisingly, the study of cheap talk connects intimately with aspects of pop culture. More surprising, however, is the idea that the cheapness of talk is not only a currently recognized property of our language, but that it might serve to define the very essence of human language in general and offer insights into the origins and nature of our ability to speak at all.

descCRN[30049] = '<p>*Cross-listed with SOCI 175-01*<br/>Sociolinguistics is the study of the social language variation inevitable in all societies, be they closed and uniform or diverse and multicultural. Language and culture are so closely tied that it is nearly impossible to discuss language variation without also understanding its relation to culture. As humans, we judge each other constantly on the basis of the way we talk, we make sweeping generalizations about people\'s values and moral worth solely on the basis of the language they speak. Diversity in language often stands as a symbol of ethnic and social diversity. If someone criticizes our language we feel they are criticizing our inmost self. This course introduces students to the overwhelming amount of linguistic diversity in the United States and elsewhere, while at the same time making them aware of the cultural prejudices inherent in our attitude towards people who speak differently from us. The class involves analysis and discussion of the readings, setting the stage for exploration assignments, allowing students to do their own research on linguistic diversity. (4 credits)<br/></p>';

Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we\'ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we\'ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we\'ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we\'ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them.

Two main questions run throughout this course: 1. How does language influence the way we think about and perceive nature, which in turn influences the way we interact with and shape nature? 2. How has our environment shaped the Language faculty and individual languages? To answer these questions, we’ll start by asking, what is language and what is nature? Then we\'ll turn to the way that our environment has impacted the evolution of Language. Next we\'ll look at indigenous knowledge as it is encoded by language and the Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis, which says that language influences the way we perceive the world. With this as background, we\'ll look at the language of environmental discourse. Next, using the metaphor of ecology, we\'ll examine languages as if they were organisms and analyze the ecosystems that sustain them. Knowing what makes a healthy language, we\'ll look at endangered languages and the connections between linguistic diversity and biodiversity.</p>';

This diverse group of pirates, missionaries and translators walked a similar tightrope between worlds, both liberated and constrained by their border crossings. We will evaluate how gender, race, religion, and imperial loyalties affected the survival of this small group of interlopers, and how, in spite of this, they came to disproportionately influence events in the Atlantic world.

It provides an opportunity for students to develop the skills and habits of thinking essential to practicing the discipline of history. This course invites students to address some of the myriad questions and controversies that surround such historical concepts as "objectivity," "subjectivity," "truth," "epistemology," and thereby to develop a "philosophy" of history. At the same time, it stresses the acquisition of such historical tools as the use of written, oral, computer and media sources and the development of analytical writing skills. The subject matter for study changes each year. Recent themes of the course have been memory, empires, and class formation. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[30432] = '<p>In the Plan of Union prepared during the 1754 "Albany Convention," Anglo-American colonists met to consider uniting as a loose confederation for their common defense and to ally with the Iroquois confederacy. That plan failed, but a later experiment in unity succeeded when the united colonies declared independence. Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women\'s rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that "All men are created equal." This course covers the periods of the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the early national and antebellum periods, before concluding with the Civil War. It also considers the global causes and consequences of the war and the rise of the new United States. 4 credits.</p>';

descCRN[30438] = '<p>This course will investigate the recent histories of two of the most numerous Abrahmic religions in African history. While both Christianity and Islam were prevalent in Africa by the nineteenth century, both were limited to certain regions. Catholicism existed in West-Central Africa from the fifteenth century, and Orthodox Christianity in Ethiopia for over a thousand years, yet the role and interpretation of what Christianity meant to Africans began to take on new meanings after the ending of the slave trade and with more European contact in the interior. Christianity became both a ways to help colonization and also a way for Africans to see themselves as distinctly African apart from Europeans. Islam, had been a religion of rulers and traders but with increased commerce began to grow. As the nineteenth century emerged a series of jihads in West Africa allowed Islam to reach the masses and Indian Ocean connections in East and Southern Africa created new opportunities as well as conflict between Africans and Europeans occupying forces. This course will look at the history of these two religions during the nineteenth and twentieth century and how Africans changed the course of their own histories via both acceptance and adaptation of monotheisms. Some of the book that will be read in full or partially include: A History of Christianity in Africa: From Antiquity to the Present  E Isichei 1995; History of Islam in Africa Eds.

Students will consider present resource exploitation in the context of the more recent historical eras of: the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, “legitimate commerce,” colonialism and neo-colonialism. They will also learn about the role of Africa’s resources as essential to western prosperity. This course will address the ethical, social and environmental implications of the system of extraction and the resulting violence that is inevitably one of the most common and most severe consequences of it. While all resources will be briefly considered and minerals such as, coltan (columbite-tantalite) and cobalt and platinum in areas such as west-central Africa (the Congos, Zambia) and southern Africa will be addressed, special attention will go to diamonds and oil and the particular mining and drilling industries in those areas. This course will intertwine historical sources, films and literature about the history of resource extraction in Africa with current journal and newspaper articles that document these continuing realities. We will also use the NISA archives (available online) to do a research project with primary sources.

One principal aim of the course is to expose students to a large quantity of multi-national Western music in a variety of genres and styles, thus leading students to a deeper understanding of the development of musical style in the nineteenth century. In addition to the musical works themselves, and no less importantly, the course stresses the contexts surrounding the musical texts. Lectures address the political, cultural, and intellectual history that directed the path of musical style in this period. Students are therefore expected to become familiar not only with specific works and the stylistic footprints of many composers, but also with the significant cultural-historical events and trends that informed composition during this period--the pan-European revolutions of 1848, the aesthetic ideology of autonomous music, the public music culture of the European bourgeoisie, the relationship between musical reception and various strains of European nationalism, and so on.

These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.

Further, we will look at the connection between the body and personal identity with an emphasis on stigma management and how identity is enacted through body projects. From performers in historical freak show to contemporary athletes and fashion models, extraordinary bodies can be a means of resistance and power or objects of social control or subjugation.

In this course, we apply a sociological perspective to examine the significance of a culture of consumption, paying particular attention to the possibilities for sustainability within a consumption-oriented society. Contextualizing the cultural meanings of consumption within the social forces that shape consumption practices, the course will consider various configurations of consumption in American society, including how consumption structures and reproduces social difference and inequality, the role of consumer practices in the constitution of personal identity, sociability and leisure, the role of marketing and advertising, branding and embodied consumer display, and the location of consumption as a site of sub-cultural resistance. In the context of the study of consumption, we will likewise examine emergent configurations of sustainability, asking how individuals, communities, social groups and organizations in contemporary consumer culture are (differently) defining the pursuit and practice of sustainability through, for instance, anti-consumerism, the green movement, fair trade, “green capitalism,” voluntary simplicity, downshifting, slow living, frugal living, radical consumption and ethical consumption.

descCRN[30699] = '<p>The relationship between academic theorizing and community organizing for positive social and political change is a vital, complex, and an ever-changing source of feminist inquiry. This course builds on that relationship by juxtaposing activist social work with theoretical writings on globalization, gender, race, class-relations, sexuality, community, democracy, and civil society, and exploring how these arenas inform and transform each other. The issues in this seminar are related ultimately to the student\'s "location," personally and professionally, at the threshold of the future, in search of a space of her/his own. One substantial research paper and a formal oral presentation on its ideas are the primary assignments. Preferred: a working relationship with a local women\'s or minority organization, established the spring or summer prior to enrollment in the course. (4 credits) <br/></p>';

descCRN[30725] = '<p>The 21st century is an urban century. Half of the world’s population now lives in cities, with the most rapid growth happening in the developing world. The globalized urban processes compel us to rethink existing urban theories as well as the very definition of the city. In this seminar, we will explore three strands of scholarly works that expand our knowledge about contemporary global urbanism. The first focuses on the scholarship of neoliberal urbanism, which prioritizes North American and Western European urban experiences and shapes the mainstream thinking of cities. The second consists of on-the-ground variegated contestations, which reveal diverse urban living experiences and propose alternatives to the capitalist urbanization process. Finally, there is the scholarship challenging mainstream urban theories with a different epistemological stance, seeking to re-conceptualize urbanization from the global South. In addition to studying these important ways of thinking about global urbanism, students will conduct individual research projects to develop deeper and more concrete understanding of the contemporary urbanization processes.
