We will explore these issues and more in addition to learning about the practicalities of a range of museum departments and jobs (including collections management and care, curation, development, and education). The museum field is broad and inherently interdisciplinary, reflecting the liberal arts at work. Thus, this course will include a major Digital Liberal Arts  project: reconstructing Macalester’s now-defunct museum. We will work in Macalester’s archives to determine what it consisted of and what happened to the items from the museum when they were removed. We will visit the local museums to which some of the original museum material was transferred. We will then transition into reimagining a “Macalester Museum” with Omeka’s digital content management system. This hands-on exploration of Digital Liberal Arts and Digital Storytelling will draw upon a wide range of texts and experts to consider how our concepts have changed regarding what makes a museum.</p>';

descCRN[10029] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only; first day attendance required* This course introduces you to urban geography, a discipline focused on understanding urbanization and its influence on society. We will also draw on perspectives from history, political science, and sociology to examine how the built environment of cities are shaped by human activity and how, in turn, urban life is shaped by the built environment. This course will have a special emphasis on exploring the history, geography, economics and politics of St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis. We will take advantage of our urban location by engaging the urban environment of the Twin Cities through local case studies, field study exercises, and visits to cultural institutions in the community. We will draw on our engagement with the local urban environment to demonstrate broad themes in the academic study of urban geography (e.g., the effect of transportation systems on urban development; city government, metropolitan fragmentation and regionalism; the search for community in urban settings; urban growth and neighborhood change; and, the effect of the global market economy on individual cities) at a more personal level. Directed field study exercises will help you learn analytical skills. Writing assignments will help you synthesize knowledge from exercises, lectures, and assigned readings. An independent project will help you hone your argumentative writing and ability to conduct college-level research. This course satisfies the college’s W (WA) – writing as argument – general education requirement.<br/>Other details: This course provides you with a great opportunity to leave campus and engage people and places in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

descCRN[10033] = '<p>Notes:<br />We now live in a world where the majority of the population already lives in cities. And yet every year, hundreds of millions of people continue to move into cities to pursue a better future. The contemporary social, economic, and political changes are intrinsically linked to divergent urban processes across the world. This paramount shift poses important theoretical and empirical questions to our age. This course uses the critical perspective of “global urbanism” to both contextualize and connect different urban experiences across places. We will introduce various urban settings and demonstrate how complex relations between urbanization, globalization, and economic development produce spatial unevenness and social inequality. We will study the dominant paradigm of world and global cities, which prioritizes development trajectories of cities in the global North, and discuss contesting views focusing on “ordinary cities” from the global South. Drawing on case studies in the developed and less-developed world, we will also learn how to apply the relational comparative urbanism approach as well as regionally-based theoretical perspectives to comprehend the diverse urban landscapes around the globe.</p>';
descCRN[10034] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course discusses the foundations of American urban life and metropolitan development today, and examines how and why urban housing markets operate as they do within American metropolitan regions.

But what is Asia? How can we understand this diverse region where more than half of the world’s population resides? In this course, we will first deconstruct the idea of Asia as a cartographic entity to excavate the layered social-cultural meaning and geographical diversity of the “Asias.” We will also place the “Asias” in a global context to reveal how contemporary Asia anchors the changing world political economy and cultural imaginations outside the West. We will begin with important theoretical debates on (East) Asian development that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s, including discussions about the colonial past, the path-dependency of development and uneven industrialization, regional disparities and mega-urbanization. We will then use these debates as the foundation to explore the contemporary globalizing Asia. What are the important connections between Asian countries, and with other parts of the world? What are the role of the “Asias” in international governance and geo-politics? Can China replace the United States as the dominant geo-economic power? These are the questions we will explore in this course.</p>';

descCRN[10038] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First day attendance required* Social scientists use qualitative methods to understand the ways in which societal associations operate and how people experience, contribute to, or try to change these associations. Qualitative research methods are thus concerned with analyzing processes and experiences. This course trains students to use qualitative research methods to collect data, analyze it, draw authoritative conclusions, and observe professional research ethics. The course emphasizes how qualitative methods contribute to scientific research and how ethical treatment of research participants affects the practice of qualitative research. Above all, the course focuses on training students to conduct qualitative research that contributes to our understanding of human geographies. Students will develop these skills by engaging in a semester-long student-driven research project. Participation in this project will help you learn how to plan, prepare, and carry out a qualitative research project on a deadline. <br/><br/>In 2016, we will be working with the Union Park District Council in St. Paul, helping to launch and support a “cultural asset mapping” project. The Union Park district contains a number of the neighborhoods around Macalester and we will focus on a small isolate segment of the Midway neighborhood. The area is north of Interstate 94 and bounded by Prior, University, and Snelling avenues. The Union Park district council would like to know more about neighbor perceptions of the built environment especially as it relates to walkability and the potential for place-making. The District Council would like to support some improvements but wants resident input and ideas in order to work with community leaders and stakeholders. We will work in teams and as individuals to support this work through a combination of interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. We will also employ digital mapping technologies. Together, students will author a report for the Union Park District Council that documents the ways residents see their neighborhood, the cultural assets that are located therein, and the ways in which the built environment might be changed in order to support place-making efforts and improve the pedestrian experience.</p>';

descCRN[10043] = '<p>Notes:<br />In 1870, the Linguistic Society of Paris decreed that all papers on the topic of the origin of speech were inadmissible. In recent years, speculations about the evolutions of language have become respectable once again, as attested by the number of international conferences on the topic, and journals devoted to it. Although we are only a little closer to a description of "proto-human" than we were back in 1870, it is now universally recognized that there are no primitive languages, and that neither the comparative method of historical linguistics nor internal reconstruction can allow us to reconstruct the earliest human languages (although they still allow us to make inferences about Proto-Indo-European and other ancient extinct languages). But there have been advances in our understanding of the neurological substrate for linguistic ability, communication in (some) other species, and in the application of the uniformitarian hypothesis: the processes we now observe in different kinds of language change are themselves capable of producing all the recognized "design features" of human language out of earlier structures in which these features are lacking. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10044] = '<p>Notes:<br />Although all humans are born with the capacity to learn the sounds of any language, part of learning our native language is learning to categorize sounds into groups specific to that language, thereby filtering out many of the actual phonetic distinctions and concentrating only on those that are important. Just as we, as English speakers, may have trouble hearing the difference between the voiced and voiceless click consonants in Zulu, so speakers of other languages may not hear the difference between the vowels in "beat" and "bit," because this small distinction isn\'t important in their language. Phonology is the study of how different languages organize sounds into perceptual categories. In this class we will look at data from a wide variety of different languages, as well as from several dialects of English, including children\'s acquisition of a phonological system.

descCRN[10069] = '<p>Notes:<br />In this introductory English course, we will listen to a wide range of American voices in a number of genres, from short stories to novels, to graphic narratives, to a play. The course will focus on dystopia and utopia, misery and joy, in relation to physical or geographic space and time. The texts in this course, although all are “American,” explore what it means to live in a range of times and places that may be hostile or welcoming, or both. Our authors express and represent, and in some cases perform, complex and layered identities that have been shaped by: national origins, regions, class, languages, races and ethnicities, sexualities, genders, experiences of war and other forms of violence, aesthetic experiences of music and literature, and time periods including the future. In the process, they often test or expand the limits of literary, as well as visual and musical, form. We will study works by Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, Tim O’Brien, Alison Bechdel, Octavia Butler, and Janelle Monàe, among others. Course requirements include: an in-class oral presentation, a brief written response to each primary reading, and three essays of about 5-7 pages each (one of which must be revised). This course will fulfill either the foundation course in literature requirement or the literature by U.S. writers of color requirement for the English major.</p>';
descCRN[10070] = '<p>Notes:<br />Shakespeare has been called the “star of poets” and “wonder of the stage.” How do his plays delight, puzzle, and instill “wonder”? How did he transform Renaissance poetry? To answer these questions, we will analyze Shakespeare’s formal and stylistic techniques in some of his most celebrated works, including the Sonnets, the comedies (Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, The Tempest), the history plays (Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1), and the tragedies (Macbeth, Hamlet, and Othello). Our study will deepen through class discussions, essays, and performances: watching professional productions and performing scenes from the plays. For centuries, Shakespeare has inspired and challenged writers to imagine and feel in new ways, to perfect their craft and pursue their creative ambitions. You are invited to participate in this exciting and evolving literary tradition. This course fulfills the foundation course requirement for the English major. No prerequisites.</p>';
descCRN[10071] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* This first-year course opens with ghost stories from the heyday of the genre: specters and haunts from the pens of nineteenth-century masters, including the likes of Amy Levy, Charles Dickens, Grant Allen, Oscar Wilde, and Emily Bronte. Examining short stories and one novel, we will consider both what terrifies and how. What are the formal qualities of a good ghost story? What are the requirements it places on readers? To what degree are ghosts historically or culturally specific? With these readings for a strong base, the second half of the course considers the legacies of these Victorians. How do the shadows of the past haunt the present, in terms of unhealthy fascinations, or whispers of doubt, or standards of greatness to which a writer must rise? Are modern ghost stories forever in the debt of long-dead writers? How do the Victorians themselves haunt our present moment? Is steampunk or Victorian nostalgia a ghostly presence of the nineteenth century in the twenty-first? This course will ultimately consider both old and new ghost stories, stories that are tied to the nineteenth-century and those that attempt to break free of it, to investigate what is revealed about ourselves or our cultural moments by looking to the narratives of things that haunt us.</p>';
descCRN[10072] = '<p>Notes:<br />It is entirely possible for one to analyze the meanings of most texts—their themes, morals, historical significances, and so on—without paying much attention to the formal and linguistic elements that produce such meanings. Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously poeticizes the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up these and other questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. Our readings will draw mainly from British lyric poetry in its different sub-genres—e.g. sonnet, elegy, ode, dramatic monologue, lyrical ballad—but we will also make forays into works from different geographical contexts. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, the type of knowledge (and ignorance) that poetry may or may not offer, and the very question of what poetry is. This course counts as a foundation course toward the English major, but all students are welcome and no prior knowledge or experience is expected.</p>';
descCRN[10073] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course explores the concept of beauty in its many forms, from feelings associated with beautiful places and people to the history of visual attraction and attention.  Reading novels from the nineteenth century to the present, we will learn to see beauty from different perspectives and to ask how the visible world intersects with larger social issues.  For example, can the beautiful be political?  What happens to nature\'s beauty in an era of environmental crisis?  And how are shifting gender norms redefining beauty in today\'s world?  The novels we will study critique and analyze these issues even as they revel in the complexity of beauty across time, space, artistic forms, media, and cultures.  Our readings will likely include, among others, Northanger Abbey (Austen), A Picture of Dorian Gray (Wilde), A Room with a View (Forster), Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Joyce), The Hungry Tide (Ghosh), Lucy (Kincaid), and On Beauty (Smith).  Students will write several analytical papers and create a book cover final project.</p>';
descCRN[10074] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First day attendance required* In this course we will dive right into the study of creative writing by reading and writing poetry, flash fiction, short stories, and personal essays. We will study how published authors craft their pieces, how they convey sensation and emotion, and how they artfully tell a story. Along the way, you’ll try your hand at each literary form we study. This is the basic template you can expect on a day-to-day basis. But, beyond this relatively simple pattern, what I hope will happen this semester is that you’ll lose yourself entirely to the daring act of creating literature. I hope you’ll disappear into what John Gardener calls the “vivid and continuous dream.” I hope you’ll use your growing knowledge of writing technique and literary history to say something fearless and artful about the world around you. And I hope you will see that what you write matters. Great creative writing aspires to more than just a pleasant diversion from life. At its best, it directly engages with life and even tries to change it. We look to stories, poems, and essays to give us an experience in language that we’ve never had before, to deepen our knowledge of the world, to allow us into the hearts and minds of others. I hope this semester will be a window into that experience for you.</p>';

At the end of this course you will know what it means to write like a storyteller and read like a writer. As such, Intro to Creative Writing will be as much about active reading as it will be about actual writing. To become a better rule breaker first you have to know the rules. You must learn how to objectively analyze and critique a wide range of texts in your genre. How did the author make that text work? Intro to Creative Writing will be for many an introduction to the writer inside you, a person that you might be meeting for the first time. It’s about the joys and challenges of expression and learning about your abilities and yourself. It’s an introduction to the art of writing in all shapes and forms, and the craft of critiquing your work and the work of your peers.

descCRN[10079] = '<p>Notes:<br />What makes a story move, a poem sing, an essay say? How do writers get from blank pages to thinking, feeling readers? In this first foray in creative writing, we’ll begin to explore the huge range of things language can do, and try a few of them out ourselves. Together we’ll read like writers, write like readers, and work the muscles of our imaginations. Our concentrated study of a range of texts will introduce you to the mechanics of fiction, poetry and nonfiction—things like image, voice, character, plot and genre. Frequent writing exercises will help develop your technique, and prepare you to compose a handful of longer, more finished pieces. Discussing your classmates’ writing, you’ll also train to be good literary citizens, capable of giving valuable feedback. The course will consist, in other words, of serious play and playful work. Come prepared, and by the end, you’ll know much more about the practice of literature, your own process as a writer, and possibly yourself.</p>';
descCRN[10080] = '<p>Notes:<br />This survey offers both an introduction to medieval and early modern literature and an immersion in current scholarly conversations about the impact of literature on British politics, religion, manners, concepts of gender, and aesthetics. Hwæt is old, middle, and early modern English? How does lyric differ from epic and romance? What’s meter and scansion? When did drama acquire its characteristic structure? What happened to literary writing after the invention of the printing press? We’ll address these questions and many more. Rich in soil but poor in military defense, early England presented an attractive target for foreign invaders. By the tenth century, England had been conquered by the Romans (Julius Caesar: “I came, I saw, I conquered”), the Celts, the Angles, the Saxons, and the Danes. In 1066, William of Normandy emerged as the victor of the Battle of Hastings, inaugurating an era of Norman (French) rule in England. While violent and destructive, each invasion fertilized English culture with new ideas, practices, and languages. For example, the cosmopolitanism of medieval English culture is evident in Chaucer’s poems, which combined French, Italian, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon languages and poetic forms. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, writers including Philip Sidney, Mary Sidney Herbert (Philip’s sister), Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Shakespeare, John Donne, Aemilia Lanyer, Elizabeth Carey, Mary Wroth, and Milton boldly experimented with English poetry, drama, and prose, publishing their works in both manuscript and print. The ascension of King James in 1603 was a watershed moment in the unification of the British Isles. An idea of a British empire, one to rival the Spanish and French, began to take shape. Growing in economic and military power, Britain expanded its boundaries during the seventeenth century. Nationalism in turn inspired fresh debate about what it meant to write, think, act, and live as a “British” subject. <br/></p>';
descCRN[10081] = '<p>Notes:<br />To the average person, the field of literary publishing can seem somewhat opaque. How does a novel go from scribbled notes to finished paperback? What goes into editing, printing, and marketing a poetry collection? This course will aim to shed light on this exciting field through a combination of readings, talks with local publishing professionals, in-class discussion, and hands-on work. The centerpiece of the course will involve working with a local writer to produce finished, bound copies of their work. In collaboration with each other and the author, students will edit the work, create publicity and marketing plans, design potential covers, and develop a sales and distribution strategy. We will also explore the history of literary and small press publishing, as well as recent technology trends in the field. This course will be helpful to students considering literary publishing as a profession, writers interested in someday having their own work published, and readers who are curious about what goes into the production of their favorite books.</p>';
descCRN[10082] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course will introduce you to a wide variety of long eighteenth-century British literature, from the scabrous and scatological poetry of the second Earl of Rochester to the country house novels of Jane Austen. In the period between the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 and the revolutionary turn of the nineteenth century, writers not only developed a number of new literary genres and reevaluated what counts as literature; they also registered tremendous social and economic changes and grappled with many issues that continue to preoccupy us today, including nationalism, finance capitalism, and the construction of gender identities. In this course we will explore how such issues are shaped in and through the literature of this historical period, paying particular attention to the relation between literary form and the discourses of satire, sensibility, Enlightenment, and liberty. Our readings will range widely across genres, from prose fiction and lyric poetry to philosophical prose, political treatises, and periodical essays, including texts by Jane Austen, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Olaudah Equiano, Eliza Haywood, David Hume, Samuel Johnson, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Alexander Pope, Samuel Richardson, the second Earl of Rochester, Jonathan Swift, and William Wycherley, among others. The course fulfills one of three required courses in pre-1900 literature for English majors.</p>';
descCRN[10083] = '<p>Notes:<br />This semester, we will study the literature of Great Britain and Ireland from 1900 to the present.  During this period, the British Isles underwent exciting and radical changes, from the fading of the empire to the emergence of new and contestatory perspectives on race, class, and gender.  In this course, we will pay particular attention to how literary texts can illuminate relationships between place and the political.  We will ask, for instance, how twentieth-century British and Irish texts suggest interactions between built environments (e.g. museums, estate houses, or operating rooms) and processes of social and political change (e.g. world wars, revolution, mass protest, or the rise of the welfare state).  We will also ask, in a related manner, how texts illuminate natural spaces (e.g. bogs, rivers, or islands) as politicized, from providing sites of nostalgia and romance to offering metaphors for civilization and the primitive.  In addition to writing several essays, students will collaborate on a PlaceMaking final project.</p>';
descCRN[10084] = '<p>Notes:<br />As the United states lurched toward murderous civil war, a group of passionate, visionary, and bizarre artists set out to discover the soul of America. From 1850 to 1855, in one of the most astonishing creative convergences in literary history, the artists of what would come to be known as the American Renaissance wrote stories and poems that would enlighten, thrill, and terrify generations of readers. With aesthetic wonder and philosophical insight, they revealed both the angels and demons of human nature, inventing a uniquely American spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they damned it all to hell. Their works were spiritual and blasphemous, elegant and profane, beatific and pornographic, irreverently comic and heartwrenchingly sentimental. Everything that was written in America after this period would, in one way or another, have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this small cluster of artists. In this course we will read texts by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson. (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN[10087] = '<p>Notes:<br />The story goes like this. While performing Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus—a play featuring spell-casting, necromancy, and other devilish arts—the actors noticed that “there was one devil too many amongst them.” They stopped the play; the audience panicked. Whether a true story or not (the anecdote comes down to us through a seventeenth-century source), it captures one of the “certainties” of the period: that demons, devils, witches, and other things of darkness are a part of the here and now. In this course, we explore sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries tales of the demonic. At the same time, we examine how authors used the public’s fascination with the supernatural to explore urgent issues of the day: laws governing service, controversies regarding freewill and election, customs informing rites of hospitality and charity. Hence, just as characters strive to see beyond appearances and outward show, so we shall investigate the religious, political, and legal debates out of which the texts arise. Central to our study are the major works of early modern English literature: Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, Webster’s The White Devil, Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, Shakespeare’s Macbeth and The Tempest, and Milton’s Paradise Lost, and lesser known texts such asThe Witch of Edmonton, The Discovery of Witchcraft, and King James’s Demonology.</p>';
descCRN[10088] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First day attendance required* The focus of this course will be on the process of adaptation. We will examine the way novels, short stories, graphic novels, and nonfiction books are transformed into films. Then we will try our hands at some adaption projects of our own. In reading and viewing fiction and film, we will engage in a comparative study of the mediums. Each art has its own ways of creating meaning and telling a story. Each has its own language. Yet, the gap between them is not an unbridgeable one. There are many similarities and comparable tropes and techniques. By studying the methods of this transformation we will come to better understand the process of adapting our own projects. Possible adaptations may include: Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt to Todd Haynes’s Carol, The stories of Raymond Carver to Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman, and Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief to Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation.</p>';

descCRN[10090] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with INTL 294-02 and WGSS 294-05; counts for social science general distribution* Against the swirling backdrop of political discourses about women in the Islamic world, this course will engage with feminist and postcolonial debates through literary works by Muslim women writers. The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.</p>';
descCRN[10091] = '<p>Notes:<br />Nineteenth-century Britain saw the explosion of the novel as a genre with many iterations--from gothic adventure to psychological realism, from sensational page-turner to consciousness-raising text. This advanced study of the the novel brings together issues as diverse as the rise of serial fiction, the ways empire served to underpin British culture, and the relationship between rural and urban life. Rather than being focused thematically, the course aims to explore the diversity of genres, audiences, and interests that made up the Victorian novel-reading public, considering such questions as: who was reading and how? What were the material conditions of reading and writing? For whom was reading considered important? Or dangerous? How were novels part of larger cultural conversations, such as debates about the New Woman? How did different sub-genres of the novel appeal to different populations of readers or raise different issues within cultural conversations? Novels on the reading list include: Northanger Abbey, Jane Eyre, The Mill on the Floss, Lady Audley\'s Secret, She, Tess of the d\'Urbervilles, The Romance of a Shop, and some excerpts of Dickens\'s serialized fiction. We will also read other nineteenth-century documents that provide a sense of the frameworks in which these novels appeared, as well as select theoretical and scholarly materials.</p>';
descCRN[10092] = '<p>Notes:<br />Suffering deforms and destroys language, turning articulated sound into inarticulate sobs and groans. But suffering also accelerates language, calling into being not only fervent acts of supplication and prayer but also the ornate literary and cultural lament. This course examines the relationship between literature and violations of human rights. How does literature represent the shock that results from witnessing bodies opened in torture and on the battlefield? How does it represent the trauma of peacetime structural violence and domestic injury? What kinds of suffering are more difficult to narrate and why? How can we use language to alleviate suffering or to decelerate group violence? We will consider the variety of ways authors and cultural theorists have attempted to speak the unspeakable, paying particular attention to the relationships among pain, belief, and the body. Authors of interest may include Edwidge Danticat, Junot Diaz, Nathan Englander, Julia Alvarez, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, John Edgar Wideman, and others.</p>';

descCRN[10111] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only; cross-listed with PHIL 194-01*  From driverless cars to wearable computers, from microwave ovens to mobile phones and tabletop robots, we all live and think in an environment saturated by the products of engineering thinking. But, what does it mean to think?  And what does it mean to think like an engineer?  In this course, team-taught between a mathematician with a background in engineering and a philosopher of technology, you will have an opportunity to explore questions such as these. The course will be grounded in an emerging understanding of engineering as an interdisciplinary field, where design problems are not solely technical, but are inseparable from ethical, social, political, economic, and historical dimensions. We will begin the course with a reading about engineering by the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, and end by looking at debates over engineering for human enhancement. In between, you’ll have the opportunity to read and discuss works by both philosophers and engineers. You’ll learn how values can be unintentionally embedded into engineered objects that reinforce gender and other stereotypes, but can also be consciously embedded for the aims of social justice and sustainability. You will be making arguments and also be making things, including a team-developed engineering project. Your path in this course will be illuminated by discussions about electrical power, solar energy, and lightbulb design. All students are welcome, both those who are interested in pursuing their academic interests in design, engineering, ethics, and/or philosophy,  or those who want to better understand the engineered world as a consumer, citizen, or simply as a reflective human being.<br/></p>';

Assisted reproductive technologies, including donor gametes, genetic testing, and germ line editing, as well as new approaches to pregnancy prevention, reflect advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying reproductive biology. Such technologies create new options in treating infertility and preventing disease and simultaneously raise ethical questions that must be addressed. After an introduction to the physiology of reproduction, this course will use primary literature to examine the science and medicine behind reproductive technologies and medications, contraception and abortion, and the social, legal and ethical issues raised in these rapidly changing fields of medicine.

descCRN[10216] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only*  This class provides a foundation in economic theory and addresses many major topics in economics. We will discuss and apply economic theory to behavioral and policy questions and develop tools needed to critically evaluate international events and policies. The first part of the course covers microeconomics. Here we focus on the economic decisions of individual households, workers and firms and how these decisions interact in markets. The second part of the course covers macroeconomics. Here, we focus on the study of economic aggregates (e.g., GDP, inflation, and unemployment) and the forces that cause them to change over time. The first objective of this class is to introduce students to a wide range of economic theory and to help students understand how markets work to allocate goods, resources and income in society. The second objective is to provide students proper scientific methods and tools to discuss economic issues, solve economic problems and make good policy decisions. This course also aims to provide economic majors the appropriate background and foundation for future coursework in the economics major.<br/></p>';
descCRN[10217] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only*  Principles of Economics is an introduction to the concepts, tools, and ideas that shape modern economic theory. We\'ll divide the course into two broad sections, each focusing on a main area of economics: micro and macroeconomics. <br/>In microeconomics, we\'ll get to understand the process that helps individual consumers and firms make their (economic) decisions and define some notions of efficiency. Some relevant questions that can be answered here are the following: how do consumers choose to allocate their resources between two different goods? What role do prices and income play in these decisions? How do firms choose their production scale and their inputs to production? Why should we worry about monopolies? Are their choices "efficient"? If they are not, can the government do something? In macroeconomics, the focus shifts towards the behavior of consumers and firms as an aggregate. Some relevant questions that can be answered here are the following: what causes unemployment? Why are standards of living a lot better today than 50 years ago? (Or, for that matter, 200 years ago?) Why do some countries grow over time, but others don\'t? Why are there (economic) recessions and booms? What role does money play into this? What can the government do to "improve" the economy?<br/></p>';

The combustion of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps energy near Earth’s surface and leads to warmer average global temperatures. The combustion of fossil fuels also forms the backbone of the modern economy, fueling cars, power plants, and everything in between. This team-taught course will provide a framework in which to consider the costs and benefits of fossil fuel consumption in the present, but also over the coming decades and centuries. We will use concepts from climate science and environmental economics to help evaluate existing and proposed policy interventions designed to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and we will similarly consider possible technological solutions to slow or even reverse climate change. We will spend a significant amount of time exploring how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models. Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics. We hope to attract a diverse group of students with varying academic interests; the only prerequisite for this course is ECON 119: Principles of Economics. Students registering for the course as ECON 294 will receive credit toward the general distribution requirement in social sciences; those registering for ENVI 294 will receive credit towards the natural science requirement.

Why has China been growing so fast in the last three decades? What are the keys to develop a successful business in China? How does the emergence of China affect the world economy? This course is designed to answer the above questions using a general framework developed for the Chinese economy. China remains a communist country with a significant legacy of a command economy. But it is also a market<br/>economy. Understanding this mixture - capitalism with Chinese characters - is a major aim of this course. We will begin with several classes on the historical development of the Chinese economy. This includes the nature of the command economy developed during the Maoist era and the period of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping. Then we will investigate the main players of such an economy (central/local governments and various types of firms). The next is to analyze the three growth engines: globalization, industrialization and urbanization, and to show how they are interacted. We will also study the distorted state financial system and its implication on external imbalances. The last part of the course will be on the future of the Chinese economy.  <br/></p>';

descCRN[10271] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First day attendance required* Global media have long been fascinated with images of migrants from the South enduring perilous journeys in their attempts to enter Europe through land or sea. These images have produced series of standard narratives, especially since the 2010s, rather than a deep understanding. With the help of theorists such as Giorgio Agamben, Etienne Balibar, Isotina Ballesterros, Nina Glick-Schiller, Alec Hargreaves, or Sarah Mekdjian, this course will critically analyze mass media images of immigration, juxtaposing them with more nuanced representations from European cinema and literature. Works from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain will be examined to study specific issues (from detention camps in and out of the Schengen space to integration and citizenship of several generations, from cultural exclusions to hospitality, love, and success stories). Each of the major European countries has a different historical, geographical, and economic relationship with the migrants\' countries of origin, and the course will proceed comparatively, seeking not just commonalities but also significant differences among the European countries receiving migrants. Questions of race, ethnicity, gender, race, religion and differences will be important concerns.<br/><br/>The materials for the class are diverse. They include written memoirs and fiction, films, graphic novels, critical essays, and interactive and creative maps such as euborderscapes projects.  Starting with classics that deal directly with immigration such as Werner Fassbinder\'s Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974), the course will carry its analysis forward to current fiction films such as Terraferma (2011) and Samba (2014). In addition, some documentary films (or excerpts from them) such as Kal Touré\'s Victims of our Riches (2006) will be screened for background information. Narratives include short works by Igiaba Scego, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Laila Lallami, Alexander Maksik, Donato Ndongo-Bidyogo, Amara Lakhous, Tahar Ben Jelloun among others.</p>';

descCRN[10306] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with AMST 225-01*<br/>The history of American Indians is wonderfully complex, but this history is simultaneously fraught with misconceptions and misinterpretations. European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation\'s indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.  Offered occasionally. Cross-listed with American Studies 225. (4 credits)</p>';

Judging from the popularity of medieval-themed television series, films, books, and video games, the Middle Ages live on—at least in our imaginations. In this class, we will look at various modern reimaginings of the medieval past, with a view toward understanding why the idea of the Middle Ages continues to excite our curiosity and what purposes these reimaginings serve. Fiction and film sources will include material from Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, the Tolkien corpus, Sir Walter Scott’s Waverley novels, and How to Tame Your Dragon (among others), and we will look also at gaming, art, and Live-Action Role Playing.</p>';
descCRN[10312] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with AMST 294-05 and WGSS 294-04* Using critical biographies of both well-known and lesser known African American women, this course will examine traditions of 20th century African American women’s activism, the ways in which they have changed over time, and also the interior lives of African Amercican women.  Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance, which coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine.  This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also seeks to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.  We will read biographies of African American women such as Ida B. Wells, Amy Jacques Garvey, Henrietta Lacks, Ella Baker, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Florynce Kennedy, and Barbara Jordan, to name a few.  Biographical reading will be coupled with primary sources, documentaries, and additional secondary sources to provide context.</p>';
descCRN[10313] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course will examine the post-World War II Civil Rights Movement led by African Americans in the United States. By viewing and analyzing key documentaries and motion pictures that focus on this important time in history, we will analyze the ways in which screenwriters and directors depict the movement and the larger implications of this. In addition to viewing key documentaries and films, we will read a wide variety of primary and secondary sources that highlight the key people, issues, events, and debates within movement history, including, but not limited to, gender and leadership; struggles for civil rights in the south, west, and urban north; the impact of the Cold War on race relations; student activism; movement strategies; and the emergence of Black Power.</p>';
descCRN[10315] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course will explore the ways in which the major events and processes in contemporary European history shaped the lives of women and families as well and the way that both individual women and women’s movements have shaped the history of contemporary Europe. Our exploration will begin with the French Revolution in 1789 and end with the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late twentieth century. We will focus on issues such as family policy, reproductive rights, labor, immigration, women’s political representation, and LGBTQ equality in Europe. We will also explore the importance of children and childhood in the context of contemporary European society and the role that the state has played in shaping the lives of young people. Whenever possible, we will approach the topics at hand by exploring the voices of European women themselves and we will consider the experiences of people from a wide range of identities. Readings will include Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas, Edith Hahn Beer’s memoir, The Nazi Officer’s Wife, and Shattering the Silence: French Women’s Voices from the Ghetto by French women’s rights activist Fadela Amara.</p>';
descCRN[10316] = '<p>Notes:<br />A study of the history of Africa before 1800, this course covers the major themes relating to the development of African societies and cultures from the earliest times.

descCRN[10319] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with CLAS 294-01* The city is a key component of modern life, but much of what we associate with urban life took shape during the Middle Ages. This course explores European cities and city life from the Roman period to the end of the Middle Ages. We will investigate how and why cities developed, how they were governed, their relationships with the hinterland and the environment, what urban living was like, and people’s perceptions of cities and urban life. Along the way, we will cover such topics as the transformations of late Roman cities during the Middle Ages, commerce and work, urban rebellions, family life, forms of entertainment, and more.</p>';
descCRN[10320] = '<p>Notes:<br />In the popular imagination, the Vikings are little more than blood-thirsty raiders wearing horned helmets who pillaged their way across Europe, wiping out culture and “civilization” wherever they could find it. This class seeks to correct that view, contending that the Vikings did much more than plunder and destroy (although they did some of that, too). The Vikings were accomplished traders and settlers as well, and they fundamentally altered the political, economic, military, and religious history of northern Europe and beyond. We will use textual, archaeological, and linguistic evidence alongside scholarly works to explore the rich history of the Vikings and their impact.</p>';

We will study the Confucian classics and commentaries, which formed the backbone of the curriculum. Other topics include frustrated scholars’ fictional accounts of the unfairness of the exam system, Europeans’ praise of it as a model for the equitable recruitment of civil servants, and women’s strategies for circumventing a system that explicitly excluded them.</p>';

descCRN[10354] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ECON 394-01* In the past three decades, China is one of the most dynamic and fastest growing countries in the world. Why has China been growing so fast in the last three decades? What are the keys to develop a successful business in China? How does the emergence of China affect the world economy? This course is designed to answer the above questions using a general framework developed for the Chinese economy. China remains a communist country with a significant legacy of a command economy. But it is also a market economy. Understanding this mixture - capitalism with Chinese characters - is a major aim of this course. We will begin with several classes on the historical development of the Chinese economy. This includes the nature of the command economy developed during the Maoist era and the period of economic reform under Deng Xiaoping. Then we will investigate the main players of such an economy (central/local governments and various types of firms). The next is to analyze the three growth engines: globalization, industrialization and urbanization, and to show how they are interacted. We will also study the distorted state financial system and its implication on external imbalances. The last part of the course will be on the future of the Chinese economy.</p>';

Over the last decade, certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as "political ecology." The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts.

descCRN[10399] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* We spend our lives staring at the screens of computers, phones, movies and televisions.  And the amount of time we spend before them is anything but insignificant.  According to the most recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 8-18 year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes using entertainment media across a typical day (more than 53 hours a week)!  Because they spend so much of that time "media multitasking" (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to pack a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content into those 7½ hours per day. The screen is one of the most important technological innovations of recent memory, for it has such a wide range of influences on our experience of the everyday. From social media and networking, online video to Hollywood movies, from email to texting, our knowledge of the world is largely mediated by screens. Screens substitute real world experience for a world created in a display of colored lights and accompanying sounds. Given this dependence, what influence do they have on our perception of the world, of others, of ourselves, of news, of reality? Do screens, in fact, contribute to what Anne Friedberg has called a "dematerializing of reality"? Should we be worried about their pervasiveness? In this First Year Course, we will ask these and related questions. We will begin to develop our own answers to them by reading and writing about, analyzing and critiquing various aspects of the media. This course is designed for students who have a strong interest in critical and philosophical type analysis of society and will introduce you to the field of Media Studies in order to help you come to an understanding of the importance of screens in mediating our experience of and interactions with the world.<br/></p>';

descCRN[10420] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* This course will explore music of the Passion tradition (the story of Jesus’s arrest, trial, and death). The genre includes some of the most ambitious, innovative, and seminal works of the past five hundred years. We will begin the term by looking at the Passion form’s growth into the paradigmatic settings of Johann Sebastian Bach. Our study will then consider several modern expansions upon this legacy. We will examine the evolving narrative/dramatic sense of these works, their roles in liturgical and/or concert performance, the inclusion of non-canonical (and non-Christological) texts, their myriad sociopolitical implications, and of course, the novelties of their musical language. This course meets the College’s Writing requirement and will help students learn to write critically about music.  A familiarity with basic musical notation is necessary and will be assumed.

descCRN[10423] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course traces the development of Western art music from its beginnings in the monophonic chant of early Christianity, through the development of polyphonic genres in the Renaissance (mass, motet, madrigal), to the emergence of opera in Italy around 1600 and the stylistic revolution that we now call the Baroque (including musical life in the extravagant court of Louis XIV in France and Johann Sebastian Bach’s masterful synthesis of Baroque styles), to the sophisticated, multi-movement sonata structures of late 18th century Viennese classicism. Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students’ abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students’ retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10424] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with WGSS 354-01*<br/>This course explores issues concerning gender in a variety of American and European musical styles, with an emphasis on popular genres. Taking a topical approach, we will examine the ways in which gender is constructed in various musical contexts and explore the ways in which gender relates to and is informed by other apsects of identity formation, including class, race, and sexuality. We will investigate issues that have affected women\'s participation in musical life, such as musical canons, gendered musical discourse, and gender stereotypes. In addition, we will explore contributions of trans* musicians, as well as issues that affect their musical lives. We will also interrogate constructions of gender, masculinity, and femininity as they relate to music. An ongoing goal will be to develop reading comprehension and critical thinking skills through a series of short summary/response papers and discussion in class. Finally, as this course emphasizes writing and research skills, several class periods will be devoted to research techniques and the writing process, and accordingly you will be required to write and revise a substantial paper.

We will approach the musical works analytically and critically, with the goal of applying our observations about musical form/s to the formation of arguments concerning aesthetics, ethics, politics, culture, and other perspectives. Through readings from a variety of disciplines and traditions, we will develop an understanding of such categories as Classicism, Romanticism, Nationalism, Modernism, and Socialist Realism, both musically and more broadly. Works we will study closely include: by Beethoven--Symphony No. 7, String Quartet in B-flat Major, Opus 130, Piano Sonatas Opus 110 and 111; by Mahler--Symphony No. 3, Das Lied von der Erde (“The Song of the Earth”); by Shostakovich--Symphony No. 4, String Quartet No. 3, Symphony No. 8, the Preludes and Fugues for Piano.

descCRN[10435] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* This introductory philosophy course focuses on the nature and scope of our personal boundaries, specifically the intersections between mind, body, and self. Questions about the nature of these three and the relationship between them have a long pedigree in the history of philosophy. We will therefore ground our explorations in the work of classical thinkers such as Descartes, Locke and Hume. These philosophers were especially interested in how minds and bodies are related, and how this mind-body relationship gives us a sense of being a self that endures through time. Yet we live in a time where our personal boundaries are being transformed and challenged in interesting ways, specifically by the technologies that are becoming an integral part of our daily lives. These technologies have opened up new possibilities and new ways of thinking about the nature of mind, body, and self. Artificial minds in artificial bodies now seem a real possibility, as do artificial enhancements of biological minds and minds that extend beyond the skull to incorporate aspects of the environment (smartphones and facebook pages, for example). Such developments begin to blur the boundaries between biology and technology, and hence the boundaries between mind and world, between self and not-self. We will explore these topics through a variety of print and film media and, in doing so, work to develop the critical and analytical skills of each participant in the course.</p>';
descCRN[10436] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with RELI 212-01*<br/>Philosophical analysis of problems in religion and theology such as arguments for the existence of God and the nature of religious knowledge. The Philosophy of Religion seeks an understanding of religion by raising philosophical questions about its underlying assumptions and implications. When we believe something it is because we think it is true and because we think we have good evidence to support our belief. In the case of religious beliefs, however, we are immediately faced with questions concerning the nature of such beliefs. What claims do they make? What would count as good evidence for a religious belief? What is the nature of religious truth? In this course we will examine the nature of religious beliefs and the ways in which philosophers in different traditions have justified or argued against such beliefs. Perhaps in response to the increasing challenge to religion from the natural sciences, twentieth century philosophers have questioned the traditional philosophical approach to religion. Some philosophers, Wittgenstein for example, question traditional interpretations of religious language and re-examine the relationship between faith and reason. Can religious life be practiced without a theology or with skepticism or agnosticism regarding theological questions? Other topics covered in the course include the attempt to introduce intelligent design into public schools as part of the science curriculum; religious pluralism; the belief in life after death; and feminist critiques of religious language.

But, what does it mean to think?  And what does it mean to think like an engineer?  In this course, team-taught between a mathematician with a background in engineering and a philosopher of technology, you will have an opportunity to explore questions such as these. The course will be grounded in an emerging understanding of engineering as an interdisciplinary field, where design problems are not solely technical, but are inseparable from ethical, social, political, economic, and historical dimensions. We will begin the course with a reading about engineering by the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, and end by looking at debates over engineering for human enhancement. In between, you’ll have the opportunity to read and discuss works by both philosophers and engineers. You’ll learn how values can be unintentionally embedded into engineered objects that reinforce gender and other stereotypes, but can also be consciously embedded for the aims of social justice and sustainability. You will be making arguments and also be making things, including a team-developed engineering project. Your path in this course will be illuminated by discussions about electrical power, solar energy, and lightbulb design.

descCRN[10438] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ENVI 221-01*<br/>Emerging in the 1970s, the field of environmental ethics began by sparking a rich line of philosophical inquiry largely focused on the moral status of the natural world and the non-human entities within it.

descCRN[10451] = '<p>Notes:<br />Einstein’s theory of general relativity speaks to the imagination of many. This famous theory resolves in a beautiful way the dilemmas that arise at the cross-section of special relativity and Newton’s theory of gravity. Some of its more exotic consequences, such as the existence of black holes, are a staple of science fiction literature. However, general relativity is now a well-established physical theory, supported by a large number of measurements, including the recent observation of gravitational waves emitted in a black hole merger event. <br/>This course will give a quantitative introduction to general relativity. We will start the course by reviewing Newton’s theory of gravity and special relativity. We will then explore what goes wrong at the interface where these two theories meet. General relativity provides a consistent resolution of these problems that requires a bold new perspective; gravity is no longer understood in terms of forces that massive objects exert on each other. Instead, the presence of matter is seen to curve space-time, and in turn objects follow geodesic trajectories in this curved space-time. In mathematical terms, general relativity is therefore most naturally cast in the form of geometry.<br/> <br/>We will then discuss some of the more symmetric types of curved space-times, in particular those that are described by the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild metric and the isotropic and homogeneous Robertson-Walker metric. A firm understanding of these specific cases will allow us to explore a large number of interesting applications, such as precision tests of general relativity within the Solar system, for example the perihelion shift of Mercury, and more exotic topics such as black holes, gravitational lensing, and cosmology, the evolution of the Universe as a whole.</p>';

descCRN[10467] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course has three broad goals. The first is to develop the foundational knowledge and conceptual literacy necessary to engage with International Relations\' multidimensional concerns. These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.

This presidential election has centered significantly on issues of race, class and gender and has seemingly unleashed Americans’ racism, misogyny and xenophobia. As citizens, how ought we respond to campaign discourse that demeans, denigrates, and dissembles?<br/>The study of campaign rhetoric prompts us to ask important questions about this extraordinary election cycle:<br/>·         What should we make of Donald Trump, who countenances violence in his campaign speeches?<br/>·         How can communication theory explain Bernie Sanders’ phenomenal fundraising and electoral successes?<br/>·         Why have so many Republican candidates tried to mock and emasculate one another during their debate performances?<br/>·         Should the sound of Hillary Clinton’s voice or her sometimes serious demeanor disqualify her from becoming the first US female president?<br/>·         Why does the language of incivility run so rampant in this election?<br/>We will also take up other questions that extend beyond 2016:<br/>·         How big a role do social media play in American elections?<br/>·         How important are campaign advertisements?

descCRN[10504] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with PHIL 212-01*<br/>Philosophical analysis of problems in religion and theology such as arguments for the existence of God and the nature of religious knowledge. The Philosophy of Religion seeks an understanding of religion by raising philosophical questions about its underlying assumptions and implications. When we believe something it is because we think it is true and because we think we have good evidence to support our belief. In the case of religious beliefs, however, we are immediately faced with questions concerning the nature of such beliefs. What claims do they make? What would count as good evidence for a religious belief? What is the nature of religious truth? In this course we will examine the nature of religious beliefs and the ways in which philosophers in different traditions have justified or argued against such beliefs. Perhaps in response to the increasing challenge to religion from the natural sciences, twentieth century philosophers have questioned the traditional philosophical approach to religion. Some philosophers, Wittgenstein for example, question traditional interpretations of religious language and re-examine the relationship between faith and reason. Can religious life be practiced without a theology or with skepticism or agnosticism regarding theological questions? Other topics covered in the course include the attempt to introduce intelligent design into public schools as part of the science curriculum; religious pluralism; the belief in life after death; and feminist critiques of religious language.

descCRN[10505] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* This course provides students with a critical perspective in interpreting social inequalities in the US. Mainly the course will have students debate two perspectives on the social origins of inequality and the political and ethical consequences such perspectives embody. The first is what we will call the internalist/culture of poverty thesis which explains inequalities in terms of characteristics belonging to particular groups (e.g., cultural or religious beliefs, socialization and childrearing practices, educational and vocabulary attainment, modernizationist discourse of developed and underdeveloped societies…). The second perspective we will explore is the relational/structural theory of social and global inequality. Sociologists of this sort prefer to focus on asymmetrical power relations between groups (e.g., symbolic markers of distinctions; cultural capital; the social construction of gender, class, and race; core-periphery capitalist relations between poor and rich countries…).  The objective of the course is to provide students with sophisticated sociological studies on both sides of the debate dealing with inequalities. The course attempts to demonstrate that even though many of the authors we cover apply social scientific methods, the fact that they come at the same empirical evidence from different theoretical perspectives ultimately determines their interpretation and understanding of the causes of social inequalities. Here students may discover that the lens through which they look may turn out to be a political, moral, and ethical choice.  For the second objective, students discover that these two perspectives, when combined, may provide an alternative perspective than either has to offer in isolation. For instance, instead of seeing socialization practices of the poor as tied to lack of objective skills required to become upwardly mobile, the student can learn to combine this perspective with the structural perspective so as to see those skills not simply as objective characteristics but as socially constructed – in other words as symbolic markers of distinctions (i.e., as class, race, gender performances) used unconsciously by the elite of the world to reproduce their class, gender, and racial dominance. This way, as Julie Bettie has argued in her Women Without Class, instead of seeing certain “cultural traits” as dysfunctional or pathological and blaming a specific group, the focus is on changing social and global cultural constructs of rich and poor that produces poverty and inequality in the first place. It is the highly racialized, genderized, and classed constructs of social inequalities that have to be first deconstructed before we can hope to alleviate those inequalities. Hence, “culture” is a big part of the story, maybe just not in the way many of us think it is.<br/></p>';

Wright Mills dscribed it. The enduring value of a sociological imagination is to help students situate peoples\' lives and important events in broader social contexts by understanding how political, economic, and cultural forces constitute social life. Sociology explores minute aspects of social life (microsociology) as well as global social processes and structures (macrosociology).

descCRN[10507] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course will focus primarily on how fears spread and become a major public concern. We will deal with a number of issues like pedophilia (including priests and pedophilia), gangs, drug scares, and terrorism. Sociologists have long studied these moral panics -- defined as public campaigns to elicit alarm about perceived threats to social order. We will adopt this perspective to see that indeed issues like these do not become part of public discourse naturally from the threat itself. Rather, we will ask what does power have to do with it becoming a public concern? What kinds of narrations are utilized to make it available to us in a particular way? Who gets to define these public threats and who becomes its object of concern? Who does it blame and who does it protect from ridicule?  Why do fears and panics usually flow down the power structure, rarely focusing on dominant races and social classes and all too often on the weak, poor, minorities, or the global Other? A major sub theme of the course will be to trace the incitement process through certain networks and what sociologists call “claims makers” and “moral entrepreneurs” (think tanks, groups like Jihad Watch, the State-Security Industrial complex, political elites, human rights groups . . . ), especially right wing groups but also including liberals, mainstream feminists, gay rights activists, and security "experts." We will also be interested in the way these politically orchestrated fears impact the way we understand cultural differences, human rights, immigration, culture and crime, gender inequality, patriarchy, domestic abuse, military occupation, and so on, often in ways that perpetuates Orientalist and problematic classifications of racial and cultural divides.</p>';

Sexuality and its components (desire, pleasure, love, the body) is something more than a personal or individual characteristic. It is socially constructed. Sexuality has been configured during different historical time periods as sin, as a means of fostering alliances between powerful families, as perversion, as a means to pleasure, as a symbol of love, and as personal identity. These different sexual configurations are connected with larger social-historical trends such as the development of capitalism, the use of rationalized technologies, and the expansion of scientific-medical discourse. In this course, we explore how sexuality has been constructed through history. We examine how categories shape our understanding of sexuality such as male/female, heterosexual/homosexual/queer. We also will address issues such as child sexuality, prostitution, images of sexual minorities in the media and heteronormativity. (4 credits) <br/></p>';

Our study will track the category of class along multiple lines of cultural distinction, examining class subjectivity as it is constructed in relation to gender, race, and sexuality identity, and as it is built around moral discourses of difference and symbolic economies of style, taste, and preference. We will address key theories and questions in the sociology of class as we examine how class meanings are articulated in class-specific attitudes, values, behaviors, and practices, considering how these meanings become distributed, internalized, and ‘activated’ through processes that often render those meanings ‘natural.’ We will discuss our relationship to the class cultures in which we live, and the relationship between class culture, cultural capital, and power, considering both how class culture operates in micro-interactional settings on the basis of widely shared class-cultural beliefs, and how it can exist in more clearly defined institutional settings such as family, school and work, leisure and consumption. The course moves from considering broad questions in the field to an examination of selected empirical works, where we look closely at how class culture operates to construct identities and distinctions among groups. Our study will carry us from working class kids whose culture of rebellion sets them up for working class jobs, to middle class families whose ‘concerted cultivation’ of their children imparts distinct advantages over their working class counterparts; from high school girls whose class identity is constructed in relationship to color, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, to the halls of an elite boarding school where elite youth train to be cultural omnivores able to inhabit privilege with carefully cultivated ease. Throughout, we will consider class culture and class identity against the landscape of a neoliberal New Economy where, in response to ever-encircling risk and constraint, working class families downscale for survival, upper class families upscale for security, and middle class families struggle to hang on.</p>';
descCRN[10512] = '<p>Notes:<br />Cities hold a democratic potential because people from a variety of backgrounds live and work in them. Yet, persistent and growing disparities have left this potential more of an unfulfilled promise. What structures and practices inhibit efforts to achieve social justice in cities? How can contemporary cities in the United States plan for their future in truly democratic, participatory ways? This course addresses these questions by exploring the intersections of political processes and urban life. The course will draw from urban sociology and closely-related disciplines to understand how urban planning and decision-making are intertwined with power dynamics and inequality. Specifically, this course will examine the conditions needed for effective and inclusive processes, using the Twin Cities region as a case study.</p>';
descCRN[10513] = '<p>Notes:<br />Law is omnipresent in contemporary social life. How should we understand this development and its consequences? How does law operate to the advantage or disadvantage of various members of society? Can law be the source of significant social change? This course examines the development of a formal, legal system and the ways in which such a system connects to other parts of society. We begin by focusing on individual experiences and understandings of law and what these tell us about how law fits into the larger social order. We then evaluate explanations about the connections between social and legal development. We also consider how the "law in action" operates by examining empirical studies of legal institutions and the limits and potential of law as a source for social change. (4 credits) <br/></p>';

descCRN[10535] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* The movies love to hate the Nazi, but what exactly is a “Nazi”?  Whether glamorized by Third Reich propaganda, vilified by allied propaganda, dramatized by historical thrillers, or caricatured by Hollywood fantasies, the cinematic Nazi is always a construct.  This is not to say there may not be some historical, psychological, or sociological truth in the depiction of Nazis, but their filmic portrayal, like that of any historical group, necessarily involves construction or representation.  And representations tend to tell us more about the era in which they were concocted than about the “real” thing.  Consciously or unconsciously, they serve a purpose: to educate, to entertain, to complicate or (over)simplify our understanding of history, to thrill, disturb, or affirm us as viewers.   The course will examine the questions of representation using the example of the cinematic Nazi—one case among hundreds, but an important one, as the Nazi has become the symbol of evil over the past half-century. The first part of the course will focus on films from the historical period of the Third Reich.  We will examine how the Nazis represent themselves in documentaries like Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will or Fritz Hippler’s The Eternal Jew, as well as feature films like Hitler Youth Quex.  We will then turn to U.S. counter-propaganda in dramas like Tomorrow the World, in comedies like Chaplin’s Great Dictator or Lubitsch’s To Be Or Not To Be and in Disney cartoons.  Later we will explore postwar representations; likely examples will include Billy Wilder’s A Foreign Affair, Mel Brooks’s The Producers, Oliver Hirschbiegel’s Downfall, Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds.  Student obligations: a series of short papers and one longer research paper; at least one oral presentation. Two exams and in-class free-writing.   Hopefully the Twin Cities will offer some cultural events relevant to our theme that we can visit as a class. N.B.: The course is taught in English and films are subtitled; no German language skills required.

descCRN[10541] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with ENGL 394-02 and MCST 337-01*<br/>Today we often hear people dismiss the Western (mostly European) philosophical tradition as a bunch of “dead white men.” In other words, the argument goes, these thinkers harbored such passe notions as universal truths, a universal subject, and an individual in total control of itself and endowed with a pure reason unadulterated by rhetoric, imagination, fiction, and politics. Why should we bother with “dead white men” now that we understand that truth depends on historical context, that the self is decentered by the unconscious, that identity is constituted by gender, race, class, and other cultural factors, that truth is linked to power, and that ideology is omnipresent? Unfortunately, this all-too-familiar attitude overlooks its own faulty presupposition: it presumes a clear-cut break between philosophical tradition and contemporary thought, as if contemporary thought had no tradition out of which it emerged and could, therefore, merely discard what preceded it. Hence the popularity of phrases like “philosophy is dead.” It is all the more ironic to see this attitude prevail in the West at the very moment that multiculturalism has become our cause celebre : all cultural traditions are supposed to be “respected,” except the West’s own tradition. (Perhaps as a new way for the West to reinstate surreptitiously its superiority as the sole culture with no tradition?) This course pursues a close reading of texts by various “dead white men” as the unconscious (i.e., repressed and, for that matter, all the more powerful) undercurrent of contemporary thought.

descCRN[10607] = '<p>Notes:<br />With the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960’s and Feminist Movement of the 1970’s, and an increasingly diverse population, U.S. society has become more accepting of individuals from various groups and backgrounds. However, prejudice and discrimination continue to exist today, often in more subtle forms. This course will examine from a social psychological perspective the causes and consequences of stereotypes (beliefs about group members), prejudice (evaluations of group members), and discrimination (behaviors towards individuals based on their group membership). Students will use materials from books, scholarly research articles, and video/film clips to explore topics such as the origins of stereotypes and prejudice, contemporary and implicit forms of prejudice, characteristics specific to racism and sexism, development of prejudice through childhood and adolescence, coping with being members from stigmatized groups, evaluating interventions for combating prejudice and discrimination, and so on. Overall, this course is designed to provide an intellectual forum for discussing these concepts in a fairly comprehensive manner, and we will rely on scientific experiments and theories that explain the behavior of the individual with respect to social groups.

descCRN[10608] = '<p>Notes:<br />What is “disability” and what does an understanding of disability tell us about human experience more generally? What is a “disability identity” and what implications might claiming that identity have for psychological well-being and social change?  How do stereotypes of disabled people and expectations of “normality” affect everyone’s lives (not just those with disabilities)? Why don\'t many Deaf people consider themselves “disabled?” What might we learn from shifting the “problem” of disability from the individual person to the social environment? This course will explore these and many other questions that emerge from thinking about the experience of disability (and its intersection with identities based on gender, race, class, and sexuality).  Grounded in a critical disability and Deaf studies framework that considers the socially, culturally, linguistically, and historically constructed meaning of physical, sensory, and cognitive “impairments,” the course will rely on theoretical and empirical readings from psychology and related disciplines, memoir, film, and guest visitors as we explore the social and psychological meanings of disability.

Our classroom is on campus and our laboratories are a bus ride away!<br/>In this course, we will learn and practice the skill of "complex seeing" as audiences of live performance.  We will work against our pre-assigned roles as mere consumers of visual culture, and instead become aware of our capacities as meaning-makers in the performance environment.  Starting as readers of written texts (plays), we\'ll advance to readings of the live, and fleeting, event of performance itself.  We\'ll consider crucial questions.  Why read plays?  How do we "read" dance?  What is the use of critiquing a performance that is "over"?   What does "over" mean, if we still derive pleasure in memory?  What are the theoretical frameworks we need to advocate for performance\'s role in broad cultural work and social change?  What is the work of performance in our highly, hyper-, mediated and virtual experience of "the real"?  Does Hamilton suggest widespread hunger, enthusiasm, for staging history?  We will read, attend, discuss, meet theatre artists, practice thinking and writing about performance.  Welcome to college in the Twin Performance Cities!<br/></p>';

The course interrogates the aesthetic and cultural operations of theatre and the dramatic arts in order to identify vocabularies for interpreting the EVENT of the theatre. At its core, the course addresses the question: what does it require to read and interpret the arts of the theatre, theatrical contexts, and its performances?

These bases for performance challenge conventional play-wrighting and, as Della Pollock declares, "expand upon traditional ways of transmitting historical knowledge."  Oral history/-based performance often breaks new performance ground, especially for issues and underrepresented bodies/voices lacking access to traditional performance economics and audiences.  We will study the ethics advocated, and practices developed, by major figures in the field of oral history and oral history-based performance, including Studs Terkel, Augusto Boal, Anna Deavere Smith, Roger Guenveur Smith, and the choreographer Ralph Lemon.  Students will develop projects in designing and creating new oral history performance and, if they are so inclined, moving their texts into performance.

However, as this seminar suggests, well-thought theory is rooted in material practice inasmuch as performance practice is rooted in thinking and theorizing.  The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to a wide array of critical theorists and theoretical approaches with a particular emphasis on how these approaches are bound to the study and practice of theatre and performance.  The seminar is not a comprehensive course that investigates any one theoretical field in detail and to its fullest complexity.  Rather, we will work to closely read texts from a broad range of critical approaches, to connect theoretical approaches to material practices, and to understand theory through our own embodiment.  The readings are situated in fields such as Feminist/Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Critical Theory, and Eco-Criticism.  The course is designed to encourage students to practically think through theory and to theoretically think through practice—questioning how the two are bound together in different ways.</p>';

The combustion of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps energy near Earth’s surface and leads to warmer average global temperatures. The combustion of fossil fuels also forms the backbone of the modern economy, fueling cars, power plants, and everything in between. This team-taught course will provide a framework in which to consider the costs and benefits of fossil fuel consumption in the present, but also over the coming decades and centuries. We will use concepts from climate science and environmental economics to help evaluate existing and proposed policy interventions designed to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and we will similarly consider possible technological solutions to slow or even reverse climate change. We will spend a significant amount of time exploring how the preceding topics factor into Integrated Assessment Models. Governments and NGOs use these models to combine scientific and socioeconomic information in order to predict the outcomes of various climate and policy scenarios. These are the state of the art in climate science, economics and policy; students will be exposed to several of the most commonly used models and to research from their critics. We hope to attract a diverse group of students with varying academic interests; the only prerequisite for this course is ECON 119: Principles of Economics.

descCRN[10678] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with HIST 225-01*<br/>The history of American Indians is wonderfully complex, but this history is simultaneously fraught with misconceptions and misinterpretations. European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation\'s indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.

We will explore a multitude of different kinds of revolutions—including political revolutions, dramatic changes in class and social structure, evolving gender roles for men and women, and the establishment of new empires and nation states. This class will situate these vast changes in Europe in a broad global context and will consider the experiences of people with very different identities, ranging from women fighting for equal rights under the banner of the French Revolution to Russian peasants to African workers in the Belgian Congo. We will challenge traditional notions of what constitutes Europe and we will explore the various transnational connections that linked Europe to the rest of the world.

descCRN[10754] = '<p>Notes:<br />Eighteenth-century France is a period characterized by vigorous literary and philosophical challenges to traditional authority and its institutions, although the events of 1789 were not anticipated by most of the leading thinkers of the period, and the notion that the Revolution was the necessary outcome of their challenges has often been viewed as a retrospective historical illusion. In this course we examine intellectual challenges to traditional authority during the final decades of the ancien regime in three primary areas: the domaine of politics and the state; the domain of religion and the church; and the domain of gender, sexuality and the family. The course culminates with a discussion of some key revolutionary ides and manifestos, and a review of th elegacy of French Enlightenment thought and its advances and limits, in dialogue with contemporary critical and theoretical perspectives. Themes to be discussed include despoism and democracy, freedom and equality, nature and culture, tolerance and fanaticism, deism and natural religion, atheism and materialism, education, sex and libertinage. Readings include selection from the Encyclopedie and from works by Rousseau, Montesquieu, Beaumarchais, De Gouges, Voltaire, Sade, Vivant Denon, Diderot, D\'Holbach and La Mettrie. Taught in French.

The plays and films will cover three main topics: the development of colonial and post-colonial subjects, the act of writing and performing while living in exile, and the idea of the Other in francophone film and theater. We will study a variety of plays and films that were written in and take place in all parts of the francophone world, including Quebec, Lebanon, Algeria, Belgium, Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, Martinique, Romania, and France. The form of each work varies widely, from classical French dramatic techniques to minimalist contemporary staging and characterization. Students will study blocking and staging techniques and explore contemporary performance theory in addition to writing literary and cultural analyses.

In this class, we will ask: What are the Japanese modern and postmodern? How might Japanese art, design, media and spaces be understood not only through the lens of Japanese history over the last 150 years but as part of transnational movements? To answer these questions, this course explores prewar and postwar trends in Japanese visual culture, including painting, prints, sculpture, architecture, fashion, anime (Japanese cartoons), film, photography, advertising design, sculpture, and manga (Japanese comics). Through these various artistic forms and media, we will explore themes such as trauma, nationalism, fascism, protest, hybridity, fantasy, embodiment, and performativity. Students will be asked to critically consider how these works operated as a part of international flows in art, design, and consumerism and contributed to the formation of new modern and postmodern subjects.

descCRN[10831] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* In order to convey the history of the transatlantic slave trade, Bob Marley sang about the process of enslavement:  “Old pirates, yes, they rob I; Sold I to the merchant ships.”  By 1820, almost 80% of the people who had crossed the Atlantic were Africans, far outnumbering the number of Europeans who migrated to the Americas during this period.  This forced migration shaped the cultures that emerged in North and South America and have an ongoing impact on modern political, social, and economic life. <br/>In this class we will analyze the trans-Atlantic slave trade in historical context.  What were the conditions in the Atlantic world that led to the rise of this long-distance trade in humans?  How does the transatlantic slave trade compare to other forms of enslavement in history and the present?  How did children experience enslavement?  What role did gender play in the lives of enslaved people? What agency did the enslaved seize and how did people create community in the midst of oppression? Why and how did the transatlantic trade in slaves end?<br/>We will consider the problems of locating and analyzing relevant primary sources as well as interrogating various methods and theories scholars have employed in seeking to understand the trade and its effects.   Students will learn how to use digital mapping tools to assist them in their analyses. We will conclude by investigating the ways that enslavement is remembered in modern historical memory and by examining ongoing debates over Reparations.

descCRN[10832] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course only* Computing devices are ubiquitous today: small computers run most functions of modern cars, are built into garage door openers so that we can remotely open and close them, read our ID cards and allow us to access rooms or to pay for meals, control robots on factory floors -- the examples go on and on. This ubiquity of computing devices, many of which are embedded inside common appliances, has given rise to the phrase the “Internet of Things”, or IoT. This computer science course, which will count for the major and take the place of COMP 123, will emphasize exploration and discovery of the breadth of computer science through the use of a microcomputer called the Raspberry Pi (RPi for short). The processor in a Raspberry Pi is found in many types of devices, such that learning how to program using it will give students an appreciation for how to design applications for devices on embedded computers. At the same time, the RPi is a fully functioning computer, and programming with it is the same as programming for any laptop. Students will have full-time, 24/7 use of the computer and its peripherals, which can be stowed in a small toolbox, for the entire semester. We will begin by learning to use the linux operating system, continue with basic introductory programming, gradually learn to operate external devices such as LED lights and sensors, and culminate with a project that uses the RPi to control your choice of several external devices.</p>';

These bases for performance challenge conventional play-wrighting and, as Della Pollock declares, "expand upon traditional ways of transmitting historical knowledge."  Oral history/-based performance often breaks new performance ground, especially for issues and underrepresented bodies/voices lacking access to traditional performance economics and audiences.  We will study the ethics advocated, and practices developed, by major figures in the field of oral history and oral history-based performance, including Studs Terkel, Augusto Boal, Anna Deavere Smith, Roger Guenveur Smith, and the choreographer Ralph Lemon.  Students will develop projects in designing and creating new oral history performance and, if they are so inclined, moving their texts into performance.

Specifically, we will examine ways in which policies and practice either enhance or diminish efforts towards change that is inclusive, just, sustainable and effective in relieveing suffering, while expanding potential and capacity in those affected by social change. We take the position that, in order to be effective, building trust becomes a key to connectivity between people, groups, organizations and ideas where education, development and change are theorized and practiced. We will construct possible education frameworks around the idea of building trust, by analyzing socio-cultural issues of power, voice, silence, and discourse. Fall semester. (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN[10844] = '<p>Notes:<br />Wealth has held an allure for many modern thinkers; the creation of a wealthy society often associated with "civilization" itself. The relationships among work, wealth and well-being are a perennial concern and have been central to the study of political economy, since its inception in the mid- to late-18th century. How does work produce wealth for the individual and for society? How, or when, does individual and social wealth translate into individual and/or social well-being? And, how does the character of work affect individual well-being or happiness? This course will examine the answers given to these questions (and myriad corollary questions) by writers within the political economy tradition. (4 credits)</p>';
descCRN[10845] = '<p>Notes:<br />In 2014, with very little fanfare, China took over the United States as the world’s largest economic power. Even though its economic performance has been erratic ever since, China’s rise has prompted many in the West to fear the possibility of a new global hegemony. Indeed, today the global center of economic and geopolitical gravity seems to be rapidly shifting towards countries like China and India, which just three decades ago were near the bottom of the economic heap. Does the dramatic ascent of China and India as global economic powers signal a turning point in the structure of the modern world economy? What, precisely, is \'miracular\' about Asia’s success, and does it come, as Donald Trump and others so vociferously insist, at the expense of the well-being of the U.S. economy? Does China’s claim to be a “socialist” economy suggest an alternative model of economic development? Does it alter our conceptions of capitalism and market economies? Do we indeed live, as Margaret Thatcher insisted, in a world where “there is no alternative,” or do China and India’s models of growth suggest that another world is indeed possible? Yet, Asia’s spectacular rise is not without its own tensions and contradictions: its growth trajectories have been accompanied by sharp inequalities in human wellbeing and access to resources, economic stagnation and debt bubbles, depopulated ghost towns, its own forms of imperialism, and rising worker unrest and suicides accompanied by violent state efforts to neutralize dissent. By all these accounts, then, Asia’s place in the world economic system is anything but settled. This course will tackle some of these issues and questions that arise from Asia’s meteoric economic growth. We will read widely in political economy, world-systems theory and development theory, placing our theoretical questions alongside recent empirical research on China and India’s manufacturing industries and their roles in global supply chains, Foxconn and Indian farmer suicides, China’s imperialism in Africa, agro-industrialization, urban-rural migration, and much more.</p>';

In addressing these questions, our objects of study will be the philosophical and empirical origins of what David Theo Goldberg has called “The Racial State.” Starting from the settler-colonial context in North America but with an emphasis on twentieth and twenty-first century race politics, the course will examine theoretical approaches to the intersections of race, ethnicity, and gender. The course will include readings from writers concerned with Blackness, Chicanx/Mestizo/Latino/a identities, Indigeneity, and queer and feminist theory and practice.

It also seeks to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.  We will read biographies of African American women such as Ida B.

By the 1960s, this area of inquiry was referred to variously as “human ecology” or “cultural ecology.” Over the last decade certain forms of inquiry within this tradition have increasingly referred to themselves as “political ecology.” The purpose of this seminar is to review major works within the traditions of cultural and political ecology; examine several areas of interest within these fields (e.g., agricultural modernization, environmental narratives, conservation, ecotourism); and explore nature-society dynamics across a range of geographical contexts. Towards the end of the course students will explore how one might begin to think in practical terms about facilitating development in marginal environments. Note: Completion of GEOG 232 prior to registering for this seminar is strongly encouraged.  Cross-listed with Environmental Studies 477 and International Studies 477. (4 credits)</p>';

Despite its continental size and being the 6th largest world economy, Brazil remains a mystery to many. In this class we will explore the socio-historical, political and cultural trajectory Brazil has undertaken while, at the same time, reflecting on how ideas such as nation, identity, race, ethnicity, and class have transformed the face of the country. We will use a wide array of texts and materials –literature, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, dance, and cinema– to gain a broad and critical understanding of the Brazilian universe.

We will explore these issues and more in addition to learning about the practicalities of a range of museum departments and jobs (including collections management and care, curation, development, and education). The museum field is broad and inherently interdisciplinary, reflecting the liberal arts at work. Thus, this course will include a major Digital Liberal Arts  project: reconstructing Macalester’s now-defunct museum. We will work in Macalester’s archives to determine what it consisted of and what happened to the items from the museum when they were removed. We will visit the local museums to which some of the original museum material was transferred. We will then transition into reimagining a “Macalester Museum” with Omeka’s digital content management system. This hands-on exploration of Digital Liberal Arts and Digital Storytelling will draw upon a wide range of texts and experts to consider how our concepts have changed regarding what makes a museum.</p>';

There has been a recent resurgence of bicycle riding in many urban settings. What has transformed bicycle advocacy from being a fringe political movement to one that now influences mainstream shapers of urban space? How can bicycling integrate with or replace an auto-centric society? We will examine how cities with and with out a historical presence of cycling have promoted cycling programs, infrastructure and bicycle culture. What have been the central obstacles that city planners and activists have faced? Who benefits from improved cycling and which people are left out? This course will include lessons on how to make city cycling more feasible and safe (even in Minnesota winters), guest lecturers, reading responses, short homework assignments, an introduction to research methods, proposal writing, and group projects.

This course focuses on several dramatic case studies of men and women who self-consciously changed their religion during the turbulent period of imperial encounters between the mid-1500s and the 1700s. Among others, we will examine and interrogate reports of converts to Christianity including Jewish and Muslim prisoners of the Inquisition, captives of Mediterranean pirates, and the nearly canonized Mohawk convert Catherine Tekakwitha. We will consider how violence, national loyalties, gender, charisma, local power dynamics, environmental upheaval, and serendipity affected the choices and fates of these converts.

This course will offer a broad examination of the ideology and artistic production of Surrealism from inter-disciplinary perspective, examining art, film, poetry, manifestos, and theoretical perspectives that framed surrealist goals and practices. Although most histories of Surrealism focus on developments in France in the 1920s, this course introduces a more inclusive narrative of international developments including those in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the United States from the 1950s to the present. Projects for this course will include short writing assignments such as Dadaists poems, exquisite corpse writings, the dérive (or “drifting), a dream journal, and a collaborative final group project.</p>';
descCRN[10876] = '<p>Notes:<br />*First Year Course; first day attendance required; cross-listed with LATI 194-02* This course examines and critically analyzes various approaches to the study of how different individuals and communities in particular historical and cultural scenarios in contemporary Latin America create meanings about their past experience with political violence. The course addresses questions related to the tension between remembering and forgetting, the presence of conflicting memories and truths and how these are negotiated or not through distinct forms of representation. The cultural analysis of different means of representation: human rights and truth commissions’ reports, testimonials, film, art and memorials will be the basis for class discussions on different notions of truth and different forms of truth-telling. A close examination of these forms of representation will reveal the extent to which they can conflict with each other while at the same time feed on each other, creating “effects of truth” and leaving room for secrecy as a mode of truth-telling. Finally, the course will also compel students to think about what consequences the politics of memory have for the future. This course will combine lectures and class discussions. It will have a strong writing component with a series of short papers and one longer final research paper. There will be one final exam. Grades will be based on written assignments in addition to oral presentations and participation in class discussions.</p>';

The course will begin with an exploration of key debates about women’s agency and freedom, the Islamic headscarf, and Qur’anic hermeneutics. With this in mind, we will turn to the fine details of literature and poetry by Muslim women. How do these authors constitute their worlds? How are gendered subjectivities constructed? And how do the gender politics of literary texts relate to the broader political and historical contexts from which they emerge? Themes will include an introduction to Muslim poetesses and Arabic poetic genres, the rise of the novel in the Arabic speaking world, and Muslim women’s literary production outside of the Middle East: from Senegal to South Asia, and beyond.</p>';
descCRN[10926] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with HIST 294-01 and WGSS 294-04* Using critical biographies of both well-known and lesser known African American women, this course will examine traditions of 20th century African American women’s activism, the ways in which they have changed over time, and also the interior lives of African Amercican women.  Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance, which coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine.  This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also seeks to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.  We will read biographies of African American women such as Ida B. Wells, Amy Jacques Garvey, Henrietta Lacks, Ella Baker, Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Florynce Kennedy, and Barbara Jordan, to name a few.  Biographical reading will be coupled with primary sources, documentaries, and additional secondary sources to provide context.</p>';
descCRN[10928] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with INTL 202-01 and MCST 202-01; counts for humanities general distribution* Global media collectively have tremendous influence in how many see and comprehend the world and therefore on the information and beliefs upon which they feel or act. While media are central to the continued production of a sense of "the world" at large or the "global" scale, media industries are situated geographically, culturally and institutionally. Even if they promise worldwide coverage or are multinational companies, there is much to be gained from studying how media are produced and distributed differently according to specific social, political, economic and historical conditions. This course considers media industries around the world with a focus on the relationships between the labor and infrastructures behind representations in a broad range of media (television, radio, cinema, news, telecommunications, internet).</p>';
descCRN[10929] = '<p>Notes:<br />*Cross-listed with GEOG 294-01; first day attendance required* Whether the twenty-first century will be dominated by the “rising Asia” has spurred recurring debates in policy and academic circles. But what is Asia? How can we understand this diverse region where more than half of the world’s population resides? In this course, we will first deconstruct the idea of Asia as a cartographic entity to excavate the layered social-cultural meaning and geographical diversity of the “Asias.” We will also place the “Asias” in a global context to reveal how contemporary Asia anchors the changing world political economy and cultural imaginations outside the West. We will begin with important theoretical debates on (East) Asian development that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s, including discussions about the colonial past, the path-dependency of development and uneven industrialization, regional disparities and mega-urbanization. We will then use these debates as the foundation to explore the contemporary globalizing Asia. What are the important connections between Asian countries, and with other parts of the world? What are the role of the “Asias” in international governance and geo-politics? Can China replace the United States as the dominant geo-economic power? These are the questions we will explore in this course.</p>';

How did their participation in the movement inform their understanding of religion? Within their respective imaginations, what kind of "religio-political and ethical figure" is America - Egypt, or Promised Land, Zion or Babylon; messianic nation or apocalyptic, dystopian nightmare?

Though torture, terrorism, and genocide are important, our special focus is warfare and capital punishment, which encompass the other sites of human sacrifice. The central questions are the following: Why do gods and states demand blood; whence the impulse to human sacrifice? What are the relations between divine sovereignty, political sovereignty, and sacrifice? What are the modalities of human sacrifice? Is human sacrifice inevitable? (4 credits)</p>';

descCRN[10947] = '<p>Notes:<br />This course is designed as a basic introduction to digital video production. The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces.
